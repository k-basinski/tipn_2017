abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Psychological factors are believed to influence the development of chronic low back pain. To date, it is not known how fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs) influence the treatment efficacy in low back pain. PURPOSE: To summarize the evidence examining the influence of FABs measured with the Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire or the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia on treatment outcomes in patients with low back pain. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a systematic review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with low back pain. OUTCOME MEASURES: Work-related outcomes and perceived measures including return to work, pain, and disability. METHODS: In January 2013, the following databases were searched: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, OTSeeker, PeDRO, PsycInfo, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. A hand search of the six most often retrieved journals and a bibliography search completed the search. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: research studies that included patients with low back pain who participated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating nonoperative treatment efficacy. Out of 646 records, 78 articles were assessed in full text and 17 RCTs were included. Study quality was high in five studies and moderate in 12 studies. RESULTS: In patients with low back pain of up to 6 months duration, high FABs were associated with more pain and/or disability (4 RCTs) and less return to work (3 RCTs) (GRADE high-quality evidence, 831 patients vs. 322 in nonpredictive studies). A decrease in FAB values during treatment was associated with less pain and disability at follow-up (GRADE moderate evidence, 2 RCTs with moderate quality, 242 patients). Interventions that addressed FABs were more effective than control groups based on biomedical concepts (GRADE moderate evidence, 1,051 vs. 227 patients in studies without moderating effects). In chronic patients with LBP, the findings were less consistent. Two studies found baseline FABs to be associated with more pain and disability and less return to work (339 patients), whereas 3 others (832 patients) found none (GRADE low evidence). Heterogeneity of the studies impeded a pooling of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that FABs are associated with poor treatment outcome in patients with LBP of less than 6 months, and thus early treatment, including interventions to reduce FABs, may avoid delayed recovery and chronicity. Patients with high FABs are more likely to {\ldots}},

abstract = {The prevalence of and predictive factors for emotional morbidity (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)) one year following surgery, with special focus on dispositional optimism/pessimism (measured by the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), was examined in 165 women, newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Patients characteristics, appraisal of cancer diagnosis, beliefs about treatment efficacy, treatment decision-making participation, coping and emotional morbidity was assessed by self-rating questionnaires. Prevalence of anxiety and depression cases at time of diagnosis was 34 and 12{\%}, respectively, and 26 and 9{\%} after one year. Prevalence of emotional morbidity was significantly enlarged among pessimists at all assessments. Pessimism was the strongest predictor for anxiety (OR: 0.86 C.I. 95{\%} 0.77 - 0.95) and depression (OR: 0.83, C.I. 95{\%} 0.73 - 0.95) one year following breast cancer surgery. Optimists and pessimists differed not only in regard to coping styles, but also in regards to predictors of emotional morbidity. Optimists experiencing anxiety at time of breast cancer diagnosis had about six times higher risk of experiencing anxiety after one year, compared to optimists without preoperative anxiety. For pessimists, the more pessimistic one was about one's overall future the higher risk for developing anxiety following one year of breast cancer surgery. Pessimists, who endorse helpless/hopeless coping style when receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer, had three times greater risk for experiencing depression one year after breast cancer surgery, than pessimists who did not. Health care professionals should therefore provide intervention for pessimists, as well as for patients with high anxiety scores at time of diagnosis.},

abstract = {The aim of research in music perception is to explain how we respond subjectively to musical sound signals. In this respect it is a part of psychophysics, the general denomination for scientific-fields concerned with the relationship between the objective, physical properties of sensory stimuli in our environment and the subjective, psychological responses evoked by them. If the stimuli are of an acoustic nature, we speak of psychoacoustics. Psychoacoustics can be of a general, theoretical nature; it can also be applied to a certain class of auditory stimuli, such as music and speech. This chapter is devoted to musical psycboacoustics. The most important topics of musical psychoacoustics are the subjective properties of musical tones (pitch, loudness, timbre) and the phenomena that occur when several tones are presented simultaneously, which is what usually happens in music (beats and roughness, combination tones, consonance and dissonance). We will focus our discussion on these topics. However, before we deal more extensively with them, some attention must be given to the methodology of psychoacoustics and to the frequency-analyzing power of the car, a capacity that is fundamental to its perceptual functioning.},

To ensure the completeness of the search, a hand search and a search of bibliographies was conducted and all relevant references included. A total of 2,031 references were retrieved, leaving 566 references after the removal of duplicates. For 53 references, the full-text was assessed and, finally, 21 studies were included in the analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The most convincing evidence was found supporting fear avoidance beliefs to be a prognostic factor for work-related outcomes in patients with subacute LBP (ie, 4 weeks-3 months of LBP). Four cohort studies, conducted by disability insurance companies in the United States, Canada, and Belgium, included 258 to 1,068 patients mostly with nonspecific LBP. These researchers found an increased risk for work-related outcomes (not returning to work, sick days) with elevated FABQ scores. The odds ratio (OR) ranged from 1.05 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.09) to 4.64 (95{\%} CI, 1.57-13.71). The highest OR was found when applying a high cutoff for FABQ Work subscale scores. This may indicate that the use of cutoff values increases the likelihood of positive findings. This issue requires further study. Fear avoidance beliefs in very acute LBP ({\textless}2 weeks) and chronic LBP ({\textgreater}3 months) was mostly not predictive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that fear avoidance beliefs are prognostic for poor outcome in subacute LBP, and thus early treatment, including interventions to reduce fear avoidance beliefs, may avoid delayed recovery and chronicity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a tool that screens for back pain prognostic indicators relevant to initial decision making in primary care. METHODS: The setting was UK primary care adults with nonspecific back pain. Constructs that were independent prognostic indicators for persistence were identified from secondary analysis of 2 existing cohorts and published literature. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified single screening questions for relevant constructs. Psychometric properties of the tool, including concurrent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and repeatability, were assessed within a new development sample (n = 131) and tool score cutoffs were established to enable allocation to 3 subgroups (low, medium, and high risk). Predictive and external validity were evaluated within an independent external sample (n = 500). RESULTS: The tool included 9 items: referred leg pain, comorbid pain, disability (2 items), bothersomeness, catastrophizing, fear, anxiety, and depression. The latter 5 items were identified as a psychosocial subscale. The tool demonstrated good reliability and validity and was acceptable to patients and clinicians. Patients scoring 0-3 were classified as low risk, and those scoring 4 or 5 on a psychosocial subscale were classified as high risk. The remainder were classified as medium risk. CONCLUSION: We validated a brief screening tool, which is a promising instrument for identifying subgroups of patients to guide the provision of early secondary prevention in primary care. Further work will establish whether allocation to treatment subgroups using the tool, linked with targeting treatment appropriately, improves patient outcomes.},

abstract = {This research examined a novel suggestion regard-ing the involvement of the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC–NE) system in orienting reflexive (exogenous) attention. A common procedure for studying exogenous orienting of attention is Posner's cuing task. Importantly, one can manipulate the required level of target processing by changing task requirements, which, in turn, can elicit a different time course of inhibition of return (IOR). An easy task (responding to target location) produces earlier onset IOR, whereas a demanding task (responding to target identity) produces later onset IOR. Aston-Jones and Cohen (Annual Review of Neuroscience, 28, 403–450, 2005) presented a theory suggesting two different modes of LC activity: tonic and phasic. Accordingly, we suggest that in the more demanding task, the LC–NE system is activated in phasic mode, and in the easier task, it is activated in tonic mode. This, in turn, influences the appearance of IOR. We examined this suggestion by measuring participants' pupil size, which has been demonstrated to correlate with the LC–NE system, while they performed cuing tasks. We found a response-locked phasic dilation of the pupil in the discrimination task, as compared with the localization task, which may reflect different firing modes of the LC–NE system during the two tasks. We also demonstrated a correlation between pupil size at the time of cue presentation and magnitude of IOR.},

abstract = {Background context: For patients with low back pain, fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs) represent cognitions and emotions that underpin concerns and fears about the potential for physical activities to produce pain and further harm to the spine. Excessive FABs result in heightened disability and are an obstacle for recovery from acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain. Purpose: This article summarizes past research concerning the etiology, impact, and assessment of FABs; reviews the results and relevance to clinical practice of trials that have addressed FAB as part of low back pain treatment; and lists areas in need of further study. Study design: This article reports on a plenary presentation and discussion of an expert panel and workshop entitled "Addressing fear-avoidance beliefs in a fear-avoidant world - translating research into clinical practice" that was held at Forum X, Primary Care Research on Low Back Pain, during June 2009, at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, MA, USA. Methods: Important issues including the definition, etiology, impact, and treatment of FAB on low back pain outcomes were reviewed by six panelists with extensive experience in FAB-related research. This was followed by a group discussion among 40 attendees. Conclusion and recommendations were extracted by the workshop panelist and summarized in this article. Results: Fear-avoidance beliefs are derived from both emotionally based fears of pain and injury and information-based beliefs about the soundness of the spine, causes of spine degeneration, and importance of pain. Excessively elevated FABs, both in patients and treating health care providers, have a negative impact on low back pain outcomes as they delay recovery and heighten disability. Fear-avoidance beliefs may be best understood when patients are categorized into subgroups of misinformed avoiders, learned pain avoiders, and affective avoiders as these categories elucidate potential treatment strategies. These include FAB-reducing information for misinformed avoiders, pain desensitizing treatments for pain avoiders, and fear desensitization along with counseling to address the negative cognition in affective avoiders. Although mixed results have been noted, most clinical trials have documented improved outcomes when FAB is addressed as part of treatment. Deficiencies in knowledge about brief methods for assessing FAB during clinical encounters, the importance of medical explanations for back pain, usefulness of subgroup FABs, core points for information-based treatments, and efficient strategies for transferring FAB-reducing information to patients hamper the translation of FAB research into clinical practice. Conclusions: By incorporating an understanding of FAB, clinicians may enhance their ability to assess the predicaments of their patients with low back pain and gain insight into potential value of corrective information that lessen fears and concerns on well-being of their patients. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research found that certain music genres (e.g. rap and dance) are associated with impulsive behaviour and a pleasure-seeking lifestyle. Other music genres (e.g. classical and oldies) are associated with more adult-approved lifestyles, such as doing well in school. Our hypotheses predicted that those who regularly listened to ‘adult-approved' music would be likely to save money. In contrast, youths who listened to ‘anti-authority' music were expected to be more likely to spend their money impulsively. Using data collected from 178 individuals aged 14-24 through self-report surveys, principal component analysis was used to group music genres that measure the same underlying preference. Then regression analysis was applied to examine the relationship between music preferences and attitudes towards saving or spending money. Results revealed that partic},

abstract = {Patient non-adherence to medication is a pervasive problem that contributes to poor patient health and high healthcare costs. Basic research and interventions have focused thus far on behaviour initiation factors, such as patients' illness and treatment beliefs. This paper proposes two processes that occur after behaviour initiation that are theorised to contribute to prediction of long-term medication adherence: 'coherence' of patients' beliefs from experiences with treatment and habit development. Seventy-one hypertensive patients reported their treatment-related beliefs, experiences related to treatment efficacy and medication-taking habit strength in a baseline interview. Patients then used an electronic monitoring pill bottle for approximately one month. Patients' medication habit-strength was the strongest predictor of all adherence measures, explaining 6-27{\%} incremental variance in adherence to that explained by patients' treatment-related beliefs. Patients' beliefs and experiences did not predict overall adherence, even for patients with 'weaker' habits. However, patients' experiences were found to predict intentional non-adherence and habit strength was found to predict unintentional adherence. Practitioners may assess patients' medication-taking habits to get an initial view of their likely adherence to long-term medications. Future research should assess the current theoretical predictions in a hypertension inception sample and in populations with symptomatic conditions.},

abstract = {The great majority of research in music psychology has focused on one species (humans) and one musical tradition (Western European tonal music). Although this approach has yielded a great deal of knowledge, there are limits to what we can learn about the musical mind from staying within these boundaries. By comparing music processing in humans and other species, we can gain valuable insights into the evolutionary roots of our musical capacities and identify those components of music cognition that are uniquely human. By comparing the processing of music across cultures, we can disentangle universal aspects of music cognition from aspects that are culture-specific. Thus both types of comparative research are needed for a full understanding of the musical mind. The past decade has seen exciting new developments in comparative research that invite further exploration of this frontier area within music psychology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: It has been proposed that depression plays an important role in the course of low back pain, however there is considerable uncertainty regarding its predictive value.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To investigate the effect of depression on the course of acute and sub-acute low back pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We searched the following database using optimized search strategies: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, Health and Society Database (H{\&}S), LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science. We only included prospective studies that investigated a cohort of participants with acute or sub-acute nonspecific low back pain (pain of less than 12 weeks duration). The prognostic factor of interest was depression or symptoms of depression assessed at baseline. The outcome of interest included: pain intensity, chronicity (non-recovery from low back pain), disability, return to work, health related quality of life, and overall patient satisfaction. Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of included studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. The authors declare no conflicts of interest-associated biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 17 articles reporting 13 cohort studies were included in this review. There was considerable variability between studies in terms of method of assessment of depression and low back pain, statistical methods, and follow up length, which precluded the quantitative synthesis of the results. Definition of outcomes varied across studies, but overall they could be divided into work-related outcome measures, followed by disability, pain, self-perceived recovery, and mixed outcomes. Eleven out of 17 articles (or 8 out of 13 cohorts) reported that symptoms of depression at baseline are related to worse low back pain outcomes (measured in various ways) at follow up and the effect sizes (odds ratio) ranged from 1.04 to 2.47. Only two studies that did not find a statistical significant association reported quantitative results: OR = 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.98-1.08 and OR = 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.99-1.06. All included studies, regardless of the statistical significance, showed an effect in the direction of harm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although a definitive answer on the effect of depression on the course of low back pain is not available, the findings of this systematic review suggest that depression might have an adverse effect on the prognosis of low back pain. Future large studies enrolling an inception cohort and employing a standardized method for assessing depression and low back pain are needed.},

We address this limitation using a novel method based on the actual attributes that people perceive from music. In Study 1, using 102 musical pieces representing 26 genres and subgenres, we show that 38 perceived attributes in music can be organized into three basic dimensions: arousal, valence, and depth. In Study 2 (N = 9,454), we show that peoples preferences for these musical attributes reflected their self-ratings of personality traits. Importantly, personality was found to predict musical preferences above and beyond demographic variables. These findings advance previous theory and research and have direct applications for the music industry, recommendation algorithms, and health-care professionals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Phantom breast syndrome (PBS) after mastectomy has been hypothesized to represent a complex psychological reaction to mastectomy, but psychological studies concerning PBS are few and inconclusive. This study aimed to assess possible correlations of PBS to current psychopathology and personality dimensions, as well as to examine subjectively experienced provoking and relieving factors for the experience of PBS.

METHOD: A total of 105 women who had undergone modified radical mastectomy were interviewed by a structured questionnaire after breast surgery. Moreover, they completed a set of self-administered psychometric scales consisting of Symptom Checklist-90-R, Eysenck personality questionnaire, Zung depression scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Whiteley Index of hypochondriasis.

RESULTS: PBS was experienced by 24 women (22.9{\%}). The majority of them thought that PBS did not interfere with their everyday life. Women with PBS scored significantly higher on the Zung depression scale. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that women aged more than 66 years were 82{\%} less likely to have PBS compared to those aged less than 51 years.

CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that PBS is associated with higher scores of depressive symptomatology and younger age. The nature of such an association remains unclear and calls for further investigation.},

Perceiving this regularity in music allows us to dance and make music together. As such, it can be considered a fundamental musical trait that, arguably, played a decisive role in the origins of music. Furthermore, BI might be considered a spontaneously developing, domain-specific, and species-specific skill. Although both learning and perception/action coupling were shown to be relevant in its development, at least one study showed that the auditory system of a newborn is able to detect the periodicities induced by a varying rhythm. A related study with adults suggested that hierarchical representations for rhythms (meter induction) are formed automatically in the human auditory system. We will reconsider these empirical findings in the light of the question whether beat and meter induction are fundamental cognitive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Pain perception has evolved as a warning mechanism to alert organisms to tissue damage and dangerous environments. In humans, however, undesirable, excessive or chronic pain is a common and major societal burden for which available medical treatments are currently suboptimal. New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis. We determined that Prdm12 is expressed in nociceptors and their progenitors and participates in the development of sensory neurons in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, CIP-associated mutants abrogate the histone-modifying potential associated with wild-type Prdm12. Prdm12 emerges as a key factor in the orchestration of sensory neurogenesis and may hold promise as a target for new pain therapeutics.},

Sixty-eight breast cancer patients with chronic pain due to either cancer or cancer-treatment were administered self-report instruments that assess active and passive coping, catastrophizing, pain, disability, and mood disturbance. Regression analyses were performed to investigate the unique contribution of differences in coping and catastrophizing to the various markers of adaptation. Both active and passive coping explained unique variance in self-reported disability; active coping was associated with less disability while passive coping was associated with greater disability. Catastrophizing explained unique variance in anxiety and depression scores; higher levels of catastrophizing were associated with greater emotional distress. The results suggest that coping and catastrophizing may contribute to different outcomes in chronic pain in breast cancer patients and provides preliminary evidence that they may be important targets of psychological treatments.},

Individuals demonstrate manifestly different preferences in music, and yet relatively little is known about the underlying structure of those preferences. Here, we introduce a model of musical preferences based on listeners' affective reactions to excerpts of music from a wide variety of musical genres. The findings from 3 independent studies converged to suggest that there exists a latent 5-factor structure underlying music preferences that is genre free and reflects primarily emotional/affective responses to music. We have interpreted and labeled these factors as (a) a Mellow factor comprising smooth and relaxing styles; (b) an Unpretentious factor comprising a variety of different styles of sincere and rootsy music such as is often found in country and singer-songwriter genres; (c) a Sophisticated factor that includes classical, operatic, world, and jazz; (d) an Intense factor defined by loud, forceful, and energetic music; and (e) a Contemporary factor defined largely by rhythmic and percussive music, such as is found in rap, funk, and acid jazz. The findings from a fourth study suggest that preferences for the MUSIC factors are affected by both the social and the auditory characteristics of the music.},

When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.

abstract = {Music listening is associated with both pain- and stress-reducing effects. However, the effects of music listening in daily life remain understudied, and the psycho-biological mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial effect of music listening remain unknown. We examined the effects of music listening on pain and stress in daily life in a sample of women with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS; i.e., a condition characterized by chronic pain) and investigated whether a potentially pain-reducing effect of music listening was mediated by biological stress-responsive systems. Thirty women (mean age: 50.7 ± 9.9 years) with FMS were examined using an ecological momentary assessment design. Participants rated their current pain intensity, perceived control over pain, perceived stress level, and music listening behavior five times per day for 14 consecutive days. At each assessment, participants provided a saliva sample for the later analysis of cortisol and alpha-amylase as biomarkers of stress-responsive systems. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that music listening increased perceived control over pain, especially when the music was positive in valence and when it was listened to for the reason of 'activation' or 'relaxation'. In contrast, no effects on perceived pain intensity were observed. The effects of music listening on perceived control over pain were not mediated by biomarkers of stress-responsive systems. Music listening in daily life improved perceived control over pain in female FMS patients. Clinicians using music therapy should become aware of the potential adjuvant role of music listening in daily life, which has the potential to improve symptom control in chronic pain patients. In order to study the role of underlying biological mechanisms, it might be necessary to use more intensive engagement with music (i.e., collective singing or music-making) rather than mere music listening.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses increase the likelihood of transitioning from sub-acute to chronic back pain. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Men (N = 140) experiencing a first onset of low back pain (LBP) were examined for lifetime psychiatric disorders approximately 8 weeks post pain-onset using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS-III-R), then re-evaluated at 6 months after pain onset to determine who did or did not progress to pain chronicity. OUTCOME MEASURE: Transition to chronic pain and disability was based on 6-month self-report measures of pain intensity and perceived disability. RESULTS: Men with a pre-pain lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder had 5 times greater risk of transitioning to chronic LBP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.99; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.49-16.76). Increased risk was also associated with a pre-pain lifetime diagnosis of generalized anxiety (OR = 2.45; 95{\%} CI 1.06-5.68), post-traumatic stress (OR = 3.23; 95{\%} CI 1.11-9.44), and with current nicotine dependence (OR = 2.49; 95{\%} CI 1.15-5.40). There were no statistically significant effects for abuse or dependence of alcohol or other psychoactive substances. DISCUSSION: Lifetime history of major depression or a major anxiety disorder may represent potential psychosocial "yellow flags" for the transition to chronicity in men with first-onset LBP. Screening for lifetime depressive or anxiety disorders may identify individuals at higher risk, who may benefit from referral for more intensive rehabilitation.},

Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with a timing task that is diagnostic of individual differences in beat perception and compared the brain activity of individuals who readily perceive an implied beat with those who do not. Activation in auditory and motor areas was correlated with individual differences in beat perception, even when participants performed a timing task in which no behavioral differences occurred. The results support two conclusions. First, a bias toward beat perception is mediated by the activation of cortical circuits involved in rhythm production. Second, some individuals more readily engage these cortical beat-based circuits when making timing judgments than do others.},

abstract = {Rationale, aims and objectives: Measuring self-reported adherence may contribute to minimizing the risk of therapy failure. Hence, the main aim of the study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Czech version of Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-CZ) and its appropriateness for use in long-term statin therapy where goal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) should be achieved. Methods: Anonymous structured interview was performed to determine self-reported adherence by MARS-CZ in outpatients chronically treated with statins. At the same time, medication records were reviewed for inclusion of patients into groups of those who achieved and do not achieved LDL-c goal according to cardiovascular risk level. Reliability and validity of MARS-CZ were tested as well as the relationship between adherence and LDL-c goal achievement was examined. Results: A total of 136 (86.6{\%}) patients completed the interview; mean age was 66.1years; 49.3{\%} were male. The mean score of MARS-CZ was 24.4 and showed positive skewing. Satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's (alpha)=0.54), strong test-retest reliability (r=0.83, P{\textless}0.001; intra-class correlation=0.63, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.35-0.81) and positive correlation with eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (r=0.62, P{\textless}0.001) were indicated. Low validity values were found between MARS-CZ and 12-item Short Form Health Survey mental and physical subscales. MARS-CZ score significantly correlated with LDL-c goal achievement (P{\textless}0.05) when all patients who achieved LDL-c goal (35{\%}) reported high adherence to statin. MARS-CZ score also correlated with cardiovascular risk level and doctor's judgments on adjusting treatment targets for each patient. Conclusion: This study proved MARS-CZ as an acceptable self-reported adherence measure. In routine clinical practice, MARS-CZ could be helpful to reveal medication non-adherence before the alteration of drug regimen and thereby contributing to enhancement of statin therapy management.

abstract = {There have been anecdotal accounts for centuries of people apparently experiencing little or no pain in situations that most of us would find excruciating. Yet, western medi- cine has given little credence to a patients ability to modify pain. Instead, we focus on the pharmacological control of pain. For this reason, the vast majority of research on pain control has concentrated on peripheral and spinal cord mechanisms of opioid and anti-inflammatory analgesic ther- apy. Nevertheless, researchers are beginning to recognize that a variety of pain modulatory mechanisms exist in the nervous system, and these modulatory systems can be accessed either pharmacologically or through contextual and/or cognitive manipulation (Fields, 2000). Variables such as attentional state, emotional context, hypnotic suggestions, attitudes, expectations or anesthesia-induced changes in consciousness now have been shown to alter both pain perception and forebrain pain transmission in humans. These techniques, at times, preferentially alter sensory and/or affective aspects of pain perception, and the associated modulation of pain-evoked neural activity occurs in limbic and/or sensory brain regions, suggesting multiple endogenous pain-modulatory systems. This paper compares the modulatory influences of two principal cogni- tive variables, attention and emotion, on pain perception and addresses possible neural mechanisms underlying each of these influences.},

We only included prospective studies that investigated a cohort of participants with acute or sub-acute nonspecific low back pain (pain of less than 12 weeks duration). The prognostic factor of interest was depression or symptoms of depression assessed at baseline. The outcome of interest included: pain intensity, chronicity (non-recovery from low back pain), disability, return to work, health related quality of life, and overall patient satisfaction. Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of included studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. The authors declare no conflicts of interest-associated biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 17 articles reporting 13 cohort studies were included in this review. There was considerable variability between studies in terms of method of assessment of depression and low back pain, statistical methods, and follow up length, which precluded the quantitative synthesis of the results. Definition of outcomes varied across studies, but overall they could be divided into work-related outcome measures, followed by disability, pain, self-perceived recovery, and mixed outcomes. Eleven out of 17 articles (or 8 out of 13 cohorts) reported that symptoms of depression at baseline are related to worse low back pain outcomes (measured in various ways) at follow up and the effect sizes (odds ratio) ranged from 1.04 to 2.47. Only two studies that did not find a statistical significant association reported quantitative results: OR = 1.03, 95{\%} CI 0.98-1.08 and OR = 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.99-1.06. All included studies, regardless of the statistical significance, showed an effect in the direction of harm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Although a definitive answer on the effect of depression on the course of low back pain is not available, the findings of this systematic review suggest that depression might have an adverse effect on the prognosis of low back pain. Future large studies enrolling an inception cohort and employing a standardized method for assessing depression and low back pain are needed.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of prospective cohort studies in low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the evidence implicating psychological factors in the development of chronicity in low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The biopsychosocial model is gaining acceptance in low back pain, and has provided a basis for screening measurements, guidelines and interventions; however, to date, the unique contribution of psychological factors in the transition from an acute presentation to chronicity has not been rigorously assessed. METHODS: A systematic literature search was followed by the application of three sets of criteria to each study: methodologic quality, quality of measurement of psychological factors, and quality of statistical analysis. Two reviewers blindly coded each study, followed by independent assessment by a statistician. Studies were divided into three environments: primary care settings, pain clinics, and workplace. RESULTS: Twenty-five publications (18 cohorts) included psychological factors at baseline. Six of these met acceptability criteria for methodology, psychological measurement, and statistical analysis. Increased risk of chronicity (persisting symptoms and/or disability) from psychological distress/depressive mood and, to a lesser extent, somatization emerged as the main findings. Acceptable evidence generally was not found for other psychological factors, although weak support emerged for the role of catastrophizing as a coping strategy. CONCLUSION: Psychological factors (notably distress, depressive mood, and somatization) are implicated in the transition to chronic low back pain. The development and testing of clinical interventions specifically targeting these factors is indicated. In view of the importance attributed to other psychological factors (particularly coping strategies and fear avoidance) there is a need to clarify their role in back-related disability through rigorous prospective studies.

A comparison of the "design features" of music with those of language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important differences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic, rather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core of music and language. I next review various animal communication systems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird and whale "song") or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming). A crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals (like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter, ape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build upon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates and mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species since our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of vocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological and neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling systems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents a fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I next discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution, concluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental music is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end with a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding that no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate to explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions about the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively and are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology. In contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends for our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: As a method of experimental pain induction, the cold pressor test is thought to mimic the effects of chronic conditions effectively. A survey of previous studies using the cold pressor, however, revealed a lack of standardization and control of water temperature, questioning comparability and reliability. This study reports the influence of temperature on pain tolerance and intensity by using a commercially available circulating water bath. Twenty-six participants (12 men, 14 women) underwent 4 cold pressor trials with temperature order counterbalanced across 1 degrees C, 3 degrees C, 5 degrees C, and 7 degrees C, temperatures representative of the range used in previous literature. After each cold immersion participants rated pain intensity on a visual analogue scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Tolerance times were recorded for each trial. Significant main effects of temperature were found for tolerance time, with higher temperatures resulting in longer times, and pain intensity, with lower temperatures resulting in higher intensities. Gender differences were found, with men tolerating the stimulus for significantly longer than women. It was concluded that small differences in water temperature have a significant effect on pain intensity and tolerance time. The use of cold pressor equipment that ensures a precise constant temperature of circulating water is necessary to ensure comparable and reliable results. PERSPECTIVE: The cold pressor method of experimental pain induction has been widely used in the evaluation of psychological and physiological pain treatments. This article highlights the need for clear methodologic guidelines for the technique and demonstrates that very minor changes in experimental protocol can produce significant differences.},

Two studies examined whether older adults make more immediate decisions than younger adults about treatments for prostate or breast cancer in authentic scenarios. Findings clearly showed that older adults were more likely to make immediate decisions than younger adults. The research is important because it not only demonstrates the consistency of this age-related effect across disease domains, gender, ethnic groups, and prevalent education levels but begins to investigate a model to explain the effect. Major reasons for the effect focus on treatment knowledge, interest and engagement, and cognitive resources. Treatment knowledge, general cancer knowledge, interest, and cognitive resources relate to different ways of processing treatment information and preferences for immediate versus delayed decision making. Adults with high knowledge of treatments on a reliable test tended to make immediate treatment decisions, which supports the knowledge explanation. Adults with more cognitive resources and more interest tended to delay their treatment decisions. Little support was found for a cohort explanation for the relationship between age and preference for immediate medical decision making.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the character and frequency of fear of progression (FoP) and to clarify its relationship with cancer-related intrusive cognitions in breast cancer survivors.

METHODS: A sample of 1083 patients was recruited in this cross-sectional study through a population-based Cancer Registry an average of 47 month following diagnosis (66{\%} response rate). Participants completed self-report measures assessing fear of cancer progression (FoP-Q-SF), posttraumatic stress-disorder symptoms (PCL-C), coping strategies (DWI) and quality of life (QoL) (SF-8).

RESULTS: In total, 23.6{\%} of women were classified as having moderate to high FoP. Being nervous prior to doctors' appointments or examinations and being afraid of relying on strangers for activities of daily living were the most frequent fears. FoP was significantly associated with younger age, having children, disease progress, chemotherapy, perceived amount of impairments, physical and mental QoL, but not with time since initial diagnosis. Intrusive cognitions were screened in 37{\%} of the sample. We found significant correlations between FoP and intrusive thoughts (r=0.63), avoidance (r=0.57), hyperarousal (r=0.54) and posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis (r=0.42). Factors significantly associated with moderate and high FoP included a depressive coping style as well as an active problem-oriented coping style, intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms (Nagelkerke's R(2)=0.44).

CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study give information regarding the frequency and the character of anxiety in breast cancer survivors and underline the relation of FoP to the reality of living with breast cancer. Results suggest that intrusive cognitions as well as avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms seem to be closely related to future-oriented fears of cancer recurrence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pain is a complex phenomenon influenced by context and person-specific factors. Affective dimensions of pain involve both enduring personality traits and fleeting emotional states. We examined how personality traits and emotional states are linked with clinical and evoked pain in a twin sample.

METHODS: 99 female twin pairs were evaluated for clinical and evoked pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and dolorimetry, and completed the 120-item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and ratings of stress and mood. Using a co-twin control design we examined a) the relationship of personality traits and emotional states with clinical and evoked pain and b) whether genetics and common environment (i.e. familial factors) may account for the associations.

RESULTS: Neuroticism was associated with the sensory component of the MPQ; this relationship was not confounded by familial factors. None of the emotional state measures was associated with the MPQ. PANAS negative affect was associated with lower evoked pressure pain threshold and tolerance; these associations were confounded by familial factors. There were no associations between IPIP traits and evoked pain.

CONCLUSIONS: A relationship exists between neuroticism and clinical pain that is not confounded by familial factors. There is no similar relationship between negative emotional states and clinical pain. In contrast, the relationship between negative emotional states and evoked pain is strong while the relationship with enduring personality traits is weak. The relationship between negative emotional states and evoked pain appears to be non-causal and due to familial factors.},

abstract = {This study evaluated a theoretically and empirically based model of the progression of acute neck and back pain to chronic pain and disability, developed from the literature in chronic pain, cognition, and stress and trauma. Clinical information and standardized psychosocial measures of cumulative traumatic events exposure (TLEQ), depressed mood (CES-D), pain (DDS), physical disability (PDI), and pain beliefs (PBPI) were collected at baseline from 84 acute back pain patients followed at an Acute Back Clinic over 3 months. Path analysis was used for the longitudinal prediction of perceived pain and disability. The predictive model accounted for 26{\%} of the variance in persistent pain intensity and 58{\%} of the variance in perceived physical disability at 3 months. Greater exposure to past traumatic life events and depressed mood were most predictive of chronic pain; depressed mood and negative pain beliefs were most predictive of chronic disability. More cumulative traumatic life events, higher levels of depression in the early stages of a new pain episode, and early beliefs that pain may be permanent significantly contribute to increased severity of subsequent pain and disability. Replication in a larger sample is desirable to confirm these paths. Early detection of elevated depressive symptoms and high trauma exposure may identify individuals at greater risk for developing chronic pain syndromes who may benefit from early multidisciplinary intervention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how anxious and avoidant adult attachment styles moderate within-day associations between pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and social coping.

METHOD: Two-hundred and ten women with osteoarthritis and/or fibromyalgia from the community completed an initial questionnaire assessing attachment dimensions and a 30 day electronic diary. Outcomes were measured with daily ratings of pain intensity, catastrophizing, and social coping.

RESULTS: Attachment anxiety showed a context-specific relation with catastrophizing: days of increased pain predicted greater increases in pain catastrophizing for women who were anxious compared to nonanxious women. Attachment avoidance scores were related to higher mean levels of pain intensity and pain catastrophizing, and lower mean levels of social coping, across the diary period. In addition, compared to nonavoidant women, avoidant women showed smaller increases in use of social coping strategies on days of high catastrophizing.

CONCLUSIONS: Dimensions of adult attachment, anxiety and avoidance, predict different aspects of daily pain and pain coping in women with chronic pain. Findings suggest that a social development perspective can inform our understanding of adjustment to chronic pain and the creation and use of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the use of music as an adjuvant to the control of pain, especially in medical procedures. Surgery causes stress and anxiety that exacerbates the experience of pain. Self-report of and physiological measures on post-surgical patients indicate that music therapy or music stimulation reduces the perception of pain, both alone and when part of a multimodal pain management program, and can reduce the need for pharmaceutical interventions. However, multimodal pain therapy, including non-pharmacological interventions after surgery, is still rare in medical practice. We summarize how music can enhance medical therapies and can be used as an adjuvant with other pain-management programs to increase the effectiveness of those therapies. As summarized, we currently know that musical pieces chosen by the patient are commonly, but not always, more effective than pieces chosen by another person. Further research should focus both on finding the specific indications and contra-indications of music therapy and on the biological and neurological pathways responsible for those findings (related evidence has implicated brain opioid and oxytocin mechanisms in affective changes evoked by music). In turn, these findings will allow medical investigators and practitioners to design guidelines and reliable, standardized applications for this promising method of pain management in modern medicine.},

The degree of activity in the mesolimbic striatal regions, especially the nucleus accumbens, during music listening was the best predictor of the amount listeners were willing to spend on previously unheard music in an auction paradigm. Importantly, the auditory cortices, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal regions showed increased activity during listening conditions requiring valuation, but did not predict reward value, which was instead predicted by increasing functional connectivity of these regions with the nucleus accumbens as the reward value increased. Thus, aesthetic rewards arise from the interaction between mesolimbic reward circuitry and cortical networks involved in perceptual analysis and valuation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychosocial stressors in the workplace are a cause of anxiety and depressive illnesses, suicide and family disruption.

METHODS: The present review synthesizes the evidence from existing systematic reviews published between 1990 and July 2011. We assessed the effectiveness of individual, organisational and mixed interventions on two outcomes: mental health and absenteeism.

RESULTS: In total, 23 systematic reviews included 499 primary studies; there were 11 meta-analyses and 12 narrative reviews. Meta-analytic studies found a greater effect size of individual interventions on individual outcomes. Organisational interventions showed mixed evidence of benefit. Organisational programmes for physical activity showed a reduction in absenteeism. The findings from the meta-analytic reviews were consistent with the findings from the narrative reviews. Specifically, cognitive-behavioural programmes produced larger effects at the individual level compared with other interventions. Some interventions appeared to lead to deterioration in mental health and absenteeism outcomes.Gaps in the literature include studies of organisational outcomes like absenteeism, the influence of specific occupations and size of organisations, and studies of the comparative effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.

CONCLUSIONS: Individual interventions (like CBT) improve individuals' mental health. Physical activity as an organisational intervention reduces absenteeism. Research needs to target gaps in the evidence.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted on workers claiming earnings-related compensation for low back pain. Information obtained at the time of the initial claim was linked to compensation status (still claiming or not claiming) 3 months later.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To identify individual, psychosocial, and workplace risk factors associated with the transition from acute to chronic occupational back pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the magnitude of the economic and social costs associated with chronic occupational back pain, few prospective studies have investigated risk factors identifiable in the acute stage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: At the time of the initial compensation claim, a self-administered questionnaire was used to gather information on a wide range of risk factors. Then 3 months later, chronicity was determined from claimants' computerized records.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The findings showed that 3 months after the initial assessment, 204 of the recruited 854 claimants (23.9{\%}) still were receiving compensation payments. A combined multiple regression model of individual, psychosocial, and workplace risk factors demonstrated that severe leg pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.9), obesity (OR, 1.7), all three Oswestry Disability Index categories above minimal disability (OR, 3.1-4), a General Health Questionnaire score of at least 6 (OR, 1.9), unavailability of light duties on return to work (OR, 1.7), and a job requirement of lifting for three fourths of the day or more all were significant, independent determinants of chronicity (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Simple self-report measures of individual, psychosocial, and workplace factors administered when earnings-related compensation for back pain is claimed initially can identify individuals with increased odds for development of chronic occupational disability.},

abstract = {In this review, we integrate recent human and animal studies from the viewpoint of chronic pain. First, we briefly review the impact of chronic pain on society and address current pitfalls of its definition and clinical management. Second, we examine pain mechanisms via nociceptive information transmission cephalad and its impact and interaction with the cortex. Third, we present recent discoveries on the active role of the cortex in chronic pain, with findings indicating that the human cortex continuously reorganizes as it lives in chronic pain. We also introduce data emphasizing that distinct chronic pain conditions impact on the cortex in unique patterns. Fourth, animal studies regarding nociceptive transmission, recent evidence for supraspinal reorganization during pain, the necessity of descending modulation for maintenance of neuropathic behavior, and the impact of cortical manipulations on neuropathic pain is also reviewed. We further expound on the notion that chronic pain can be reformulated within the context of learning and memory, and demonstrate the relevance of the idea in the design of novel pharmacotherapies. Lastly, we integrate the human and animal data into a unified working model outlining the mechanism by which acute pain transitions into a chronic state. It incorporates knowledge of underlying brain structures and their reorganization, and also includes specific variations as a function of pain persistence and injury type, thereby providing mechanistic descriptions of several unique chronic pain conditions within a single model. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two life span hypotheses, derived from an entrainment theory of timing and event tracking, were tested. A preferred period hypothesis predicted a monotonic slowing of a preferred rate (tempo) of event tracking across the life span. An entrainment region hypothesis predicted a quadratic profile in the range of event rates that produced effective timing across the life span; specifically, age-specific entrainment regions should be narrower in childhood and late adulthood than in midlife. Findings across tasks provide converging support for both hypotheses. Implications of these findings are discussed for understanding critical periods in development and age-related slowing of event timing.},

abstract = {Democracy refers in some rough way to the degree to which power and influence over significant decisions for a society is diffused throughout that society. Political participation, therefore, will increase the extent to which a nation is democratic only insofar as such participation involves at some point influence by the participant over governmental decisions. Participatory acts whose function is to express support for the government are important, but not as crucial to democracy as are acts that involve influence. The data on differences among social groups in citizen competence suggest that it makes a great deal of difference who you are within your own country whether or not you believe yourself able to influence a local regulation. If you have more education, a higher status or are male, you are clearly more likely to consider yourself competent. In this sense, one's self-perceptions of one's role as a citizen vary greatly with one's social position within a nation. But whether or not the local competent believes that his friends and neighbors are available to help him in a situation of this sort depends relatively little on his social position within a nation, but depends heavily on what nation he happens to be in. Political competence, thus, grows with higher education or occupational status, but the style of political competence seems to be rooted more in general political culture.},

abstract = {Context: Previous research suggests that patients receiving palliative care may simultaneously experience poorly managed pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms as a result of their deteriorating health. Objectives: To: 1) examine predictors of PTSD-related symptoms in patients requiring palliative care; 2) assess whether anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, and pain anxiety mediate the relationship between pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms; and 3) evaluate the impact of these variables on pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms. Methods: One hundred patients receiving palliative care at one of two palliative care sites in London, ON, Canada, completed the PTSD Checklist - Civilian version (PCL-C), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20). Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, PCS and PASS-20 scores as predictors of PCL-C scores; and mediation analyses were used to test the effect of HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, PCS, and PASS-20 on the relationship between BPI-SF interference and PCL-C. Mediators that significantly affected this relationship in the individual mediator models were entered into a multiple mediator model. Results: Only pain anxiety and pain catastrophizing emerged as significant mediators of the relationship between pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms. After being entered in a multiple mediator model, pain anxiety emerged as the strongest mediator. Conclusion: The findings of the present study reveal that pain and PTSD-related symptoms are important concerns in palliative care, and that pain must be addressed to best meet the needs of this population. ?? 2013 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

abstract = {Placebo analgesia was produced by conditioning trials wherein heat induced experimental pain was surreptitiously reduced in order to test psychological factors of expectancy and desire for pain reduction as possible mediators of placebo analgesia. The magnitudes of placebo effects were assessed after these conditioning trials and during trials wherein stimulus intensities were reestablished to original baseline levels. In addition, analyses were made of the influence of these psychological factors on concurrently assessed pain and remembered pain intensities. Statistically reliable placebo effects on sensory and affective measures of pain were graded according to the extent of surreptitious lowering of stimulus strength during the manipulation trials, consistent with conditioning. However, all of these effects were strongly associated with expectancy but not desire for relief. These results show that although conditioning may be sufficient for placebo analgesia, it is likely to be mediated by expectancy. The results further demonstrated that placebo effects based on remembered pain were 3 to 4 times greater than those based on concurrently assessed placebo effects, primarily because baseline pain was remembered as being much more intense than it actually was. However, similar to concurrent placebo effects, remembered placebo effects were strongly associated with expected pain levels that occurred just after conditioning. Taken together, these results suggest that magnitudes of placebo effect are dependent on multiple factors, including conditioning, expectancy, and whether analgesia is assessed concurrently or retrospectively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Not recognising a symptom as suspicious is a common reason given by cancer patients for delayed help-seeking; but inevitably this is retrospective. We therefore investigated associations between recognition of warning signs for breast, colorectal and lung cancer and anticipated time to help-seeking for symptoms of each cancer.

METHODS: Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with a population-representative sample (N=6965) of UK adults age ≥ 50 years, using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer scale. Anticipated time to help-seeking for persistent cough, rectal bleeding and breast changes was categorised as {\textgreater}2 vs ≤ 2 weeks. Recognition of persistent cough, unexplained bleeding and unexplained lump as cancer warning signs was assessed (yes/no). Associations between recognition and help-seeking were examined for each symptom controlling for demographics and perceived ease of health-care access.

RESULTS: For each symptom, the odds of waiting for {\textgreater}2 weeks were significantly increased in those who did not recognise the related warning sign: breast changes: OR=2.45, 95{\%} CI 1.47-4.08; rectal bleeding: OR=1.77, 1.36-2.30; persistent cough: OR=1.30, 1.17-1.46, independent of demographics and health-care access.

CONCLUSION: Recognition of warning signs was associated with anticipating faster help-seeking for potential symptoms of cancer. Strategies to improve recognition are likely to facilitate earlier diagnosis.},

The wide range of genre, tempo, and structure in music chosen by participants in studies utilizing experimentally induced pain has led to the assertion that structure does not play a significant role, rather listening to preferred music renders the music "functionally equivalent" as regards its effect upon pain perception. This study addresses this assumption and performs detailed analysis of a selection of music chosen from three pain studies. Music analysis showed significant correlation between timbral and tonal aspects of music and measurements of pain tolerance and perceived pain intensity. Mood classification was performed using a hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Model, which indicated the majority of the chosen music expressed contentment. The results suggest that in addition to personal preference, associations with music and the listening context, emotion expressed by music, as defined by its acoustical content, is important to enhancing emotional engagement with music and therefore enhances the level of pain reduction and tolerance.},

abstract = {Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.},

abstract = {Music reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic pain disease, but the functional neural correlates of music-induced analgesia (MIA) are still largely unknown. We recruited FM patients (n = 22) who listened to their preferred relaxing music and an auditory control (pink noise) for 5 min without external noise from fMRI image acquisition. Resting state fMRI was then acquired before and after the music and control conditions. A significant increase in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations of the BOLD signal was evident in the left angular gyrus (lAnG) after listening to music, which in turn, correlated to the analgesia reports. The post-hoc seed-based functional connectivity analysis of the lAnG showed found higher connectivity after listening to music with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC), the left caudate (lCau), and decreased connectivity with right anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), right supplementary motor area (rSMA), precuneus and right precentral gyrus (rPreG). Pain intensity (PI) analgesia was correlated (r = 0.61) to the connectivity of the lAnG with the rPreG. Our results show that MIA in FM is related to top-down regulation of the pain modulatory network by the default mode network (DMN).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed consultation for potential cancer symptoms influences treatment outcomes and remains problematic. Delay components (Appraisal versus Utilization) and respective associations are poorly understood.

METHODS: Eligible participants were Cantonese-speaking Chinese women, ≥21 years old, with self-discovered breast symptoms, recruited in surgical clinics before their first consultation, and na{\"{i}}ve to their diagnosis. Overall 425/433 (98{\%}) women completed a questionnaire on psychosocial, demographic and medical factors, how and when women discovered their breast symptom(s), and their subsequent decision making; 135/425 women (32{\%}) were later diagnosed with breast cancer.

RESULTS: Twenty-two per cent of women delayed {\textgreater}3 months before consultation. Women with breast cancer (28{\%}) more often had prolonged delay than women with benign disease (19{\%}). Attributing symptom to a non-cancerous condition, low fear on symptom discovery, not disclosing symptoms to others, and no prior breast symptom history predicted prolonged ({\textgreater}60 days) Appraisal Delay. Low fear on symptom discovery, seldom thinking about the symptom, and consultation for other reasons predicted prolonged ({\textgreater}14 days) Utilization Delay. Factors predicting Appraisal and Utilization Delays differentiated cancer from non-cancer groups.

CONCLUSIONS: Indecision over symptom meaning comprised the main component of Appraisal and Total Delay, suggesting that educational strategies targeting atypical symptoms should reduce avoidable delays following self-discovered breast symptoms.},

abstract = {The neuromatrix theory of pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic "neurosignature" patterns of nerve impulses generated by a widely distributed neural network-the "body-self neuromatrix"-in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patient delay makes a critical contribution to late diagnosis and poor survival in cases of breast cancer. Identifying the factors that influence patient delay could provide information for adopting strategies that shorten this delay. The aim of this meta-ethnography was to synthesize existing qualitative evidence in order to gain a new understanding of help seeking behavior in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and to determine the factors that influence patient delay.

METHODS: The design was a meta-ethnography approach. A systematic search of the articles was performed in different databases including Elsevier, PubMed, ProQuest and SCOPUS. Qualitative studies with a focus on help seeking behaviors in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and patient delay, published in the English language between 1990 and 2013 were included. The quality appraisal of the articles was carried out using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative research checklist and 13 articles met the inclusion criteria. The synthesis was conducted according to Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnographic approach (1988), through reciprocal translational analysis and lines-of-argument.

FINDINGS: The synthesis led to identification of eight repeated key concepts including: symptom detection, initial symptom interpretation, symptom monitoring, social interaction, emotional reaction, priority of medical help, appraisal of health services and personal-environmental factors. Symptom interpretation is identified as the important step of the help seeking process and which changed across the process through active monitoring of their symptoms, social interactions and emotional reactions. The perceived seriousness of the situation, priority to receive medical attention, perceived inaccessibility and unacceptability of the health care system influenced women's decision-making about utilizing health services.

CONCLUSION: Help seeking processes are influenced by multiple factors. Educational programs aimed at correcting misunderstandings, erroneous social beliefs and improving self-awareness could provide key strategies to improve health policy which would reduce patient delay.},

abstract = {Based on theoretical considerations and recent observations, we argue that continued suffering of chronic pain is critically dependent on the state of motivational and emotional mesolimbic-prefrontal circuitry of the brain. The plastic changes that occur within this circuitry in relation to nociceptive inputs dictate the transition to chronic pain, rendering the pain less somatic and more affective in nature. This theoretical construct is a strong departure from the traditional scientific view of pain, which has focused on encoding and representation of nociceptive signals. We argue that the definition of chronic pain can be recast, within the associative learning and valuation concept, as an inability to extinguish the associated memory trace, implying that supraspinal/cortical manipulations may be a more fruitful venue for adequately modulating suffering and related behavior for chronic pain. We briefly review the evidence generated to date for the proposed model and emphasize that the details of underlying mechanisms remain to be expounded.},

abstract = {Listening to music has been found to reduce acute and chronic pain. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood; however, emotion and cognitive mechanisms have been suggested to influence the analgesic effect of music. In this study we investigated the influence of familiarity, emotional and cognitive features, and cognitive style on music-induced analgesia. Forty-eight healthy participants were divided into three groups (empathizers, systemizers and balanced) and received acute pain induced by heat while listening to different sounds. Participants listened to unfamiliar Mozart music rated with high valence and low arousal, unfamiliar environmental sounds with similar valence and arousal as the music, an active distraction task (mental arithmetic) and a control, and rated the pain. Data showed that the active distraction led to significantly less pain than did the music or sounds. Both unfamiliar music and sounds reduced pain significantly when compared to the control condition; however, music was no more effective than sound to reduce pain. Furthermore, we found correlations between pain and emotion ratings. Finally, systemizers reported less pain during the mental arithmetic compared with the other two groups. These findings suggest that familiarity may be key in the influence of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of music-induced analgesia, and that cognitive styles may influence pain perception.},

In so doing, it reviews selected personality, relational, behavioral, and developmental variables that have been examined in relation to the identity statuses over the past 45 years. Additionally, the chapter addresses some of the many implications that the identity statuses hold for intervention as well as the relationship of the identity status paradigm to other models of identity. The rootedness of the identity statuses in Erikson's concept of identity versus identity diffusion (confusion) is discussed, and meta-analyses of the identity statuses in relation to selected variables are presented. Therapeutic and educational interventions for individuals in each identity status are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of negative and positive emotions on the sensitivity to itch and pain.

METHODS: Film fragments were used to induce a negative or positive emotional state in healthy women. Itch and pain were induced using the following somatosensory stimuli: electrical stimulation, histamine iontophoresis and the cold pressor test.

RESULTS: Results showed that the scores for itch and pain evoked by histamine and the cold pressor test, respectively, were significantly higher in the negative than in the positive emotion condition, whereas tolerance thresholds to electrical stimulation and the cold pressor test, and stimulus unpleasantness scores did not differ between the two conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings for the first time indicate in an experimental design that emotions play a role in sensitivity to somatosensory sensations of both itch and pain.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The oldest known method for relieving pain is music, and yet, to date, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been studied. Here, we investigate these neural mechanisms by applying a well-defined painful stimulus while participants listened to their favorite music or to no music. Neural responses in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord were mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging spanning the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Subjective pain ratings were observed to be significantly lower when pain was administered with music than without music. The pain stimulus without music elicited neural activity in brain regions that are consistent with previous studies. Brain regions associated with pleasurable music listening included limbic, frontal, and auditory regions, when comparing music to non-music pain conditions. In addition, regions demonstrated activity indicative of descending pain modulation when contrasting the 2 conditions. These regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. This is the first imaging study to characterize the neural response of pain and how pain is mitigated by music, and it provides new insights into the neural mechanism of music-induced analgesia within the central nervous system. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the first investigation of neural processes underlying music analgesia in human participants. Music modulates pain responses in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord, and neural activity changes are consistent with engagement of the descending analgesia system.},

abstract = {Longitudinal research into personal and ethnic identity has expanded considerably in the first decade of the present century. The longitudinal studies have shown that personal identity develops progressively during adolescence, but also that many individuals do not change identity, especially ethnic identity. Researchers have found rank-order stability of personal identity to be larger in adulthood than in adolescence and stability of ethnic identity to be larger in middle and late than early adolescence. Personal identity appears to progress in adulthood, as well. Adolescents with a mature identity typically show high levels of adjustment and a positive personality profile, live in warm families, and perform well at school. There is little evidence for developmental order, however, and studies instead have mainly found covariation over time between identity and the other developmental processes. The present review demonstrates that the dimensional approach to the study of identity fo},

abstract = {Peripheral neuropathy often manifests clinically with symptoms of mechanical and cold allodynia. However, the neuroplastic changes associated with peripheral neuropathic pain and the onset and progression of allodynic symptoms remain unclear. Here, we used a chronic neuropathic pain model (spared nerve injury; SNI) to examine functional and metabolic brain changes associated with the development and maintenance of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, the latter which we assessed both behaviorally and during a novel acetone application paradigm using functional MRI (fMRI). Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent SNI (n=7) or sham (n=5) surgery to the left hindpaw. Rats were anesthetized and scanned using a 7T MRI scanner 1-week prior to (pre-injury) and 4- (early/subchronic) and 20-weeks (late/chronic) post-injury. Functional scans were acquired during acetone application to the left hindpaw. (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was also performed to assess SNI-induced metabolic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) pre- and 4-weeks post-injury. Mechanical and cold sensitivity, as well as anxiety-like behaviors, were assessed 2-weeks pre-injury, and 2-, 5-, 9-, 14-, and 19-weeks post-injury. Stimulus-evoked brain responses (acetone application to left hindpaw) were analyzed across the pre- and post-injury time points. In response to acetone application during fMRI, SNI rats showed widespread and functionally diverse changes within pain-related brain regions including somatosensory and cingulate cortices and subcortically within the thalamus and the periaqueductal gray. These functional brain changes temporally coincided with early and sustained increases in both mechanical and cold sensitivity. SNI rats also showed increased glutamate within the ACC that correlated with behavioral measures of cold hypersensitivity. Together, our findings suggest extensive functional reorganization within pain-related brain regions may underlie the development and chronification of allodynic-like behaviors.},

Yet, it is difficult to determine whether such subjective reports reflect true interindividual experiential differences. Using psychophysical ratings to define pain sensitivity and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain activity, we found that highly sensitive individuals exhibited more frequent and more robust pain-induced activation of the primary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex than did insensitive individuals. By identifying objective neural correlates of subjective differences, these findings validate the utility of introspection and subjective reporting as a means of communicating a first-person experience.},

Qualitative interviews were used to evaluate the various factors. Twenty-three patients and ten GPs were interviewed. A number of factors were found to play different roles for different patients groups, i.e. patients that consult their doctor prematurely, at the right time, or those that delay. A lot of the findings can be tested using various concepts of socio-psychological theory. Further research should provide an improved understanding of the way these models can be applied to help-seeking behaviour. In terms of implications for health education, we conclude that each patient group has different needs and requires different information.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Illness- and treatment-related disruptions to valued activities and interests (illness intrusiveness) are central to quality of life in chronic disease and are captured by three subscales of the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale (IIRS): the Instrumental, Intimacy, and Relationships and Personal Development subscales. Using individual (CFA) and multisample confirmatory factor analyses (MSCFA), we evaluated measurement invariance of the IIRS's 3-factor structure in men and women with cancer.

METHOD: Men (n = 210) and women (n = 206) with 1 of 4 cancer diagnoses (gastrointestinal, head and neck, lymphoma, lung) recruited from outpatient clinics completed the IIRS. In the MSCFA, we applied an analysis of means and covariance structures approach to test increasingly stringent equality constraints on factor structure parameters to evaluate weak, strong, and strict measurement invariance of the 3-factor structure between men and women.

RESULTS: Individual CFAs demonstrated fit of the hypothesized 3-factor structure for men and women, although more consistently for men. The 3-factor structure was superior to an alternative 1-factor structure. MSCFA results indicated that parameters of the 3-factor structure could be considered equivalent between the sexes up to the level of strong invariance. Strict invariance was not supported.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, IIRS scores can be interpreted similarly for men and women with cancer. Illness intrusiveness can be considered as important in the psychosocial adaptation of people with cancer as it is for people affected by other chronic conditions.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the available evidence concerning associations between cognitive abilities and variables related to music, specifically music aptitude, music listening, and music training. Music aptitude appears to be a marker of general intelligence except in cases of amusia and musical savants. Positive effects on cognitive performance that are evident after listening to music can be explained by improvements in arousal and mood. Effects of background music on cognitive abilities are much less systematic, presumably because attentional limitations can lead to poor performance, whereas improved levels of arousal and mood can lead to good performance. Finally, associations between music training in childhood and cognitive abilities are well established but these associations are likely to be bidirectional. High-functioning children are more likely than other children to take music lessons, which can exaggerate their natural cognitive advantages.},

One important barrier is inadequate measurement and assessment of pain. To address this problem, the Pain Research Group of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care has developed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), a pain assessment tool for use with cancer patients. The BPI measures both the intensity of pain (sensory dimension) and interference of pain in the patient's life (reactive dimension). It also queries the patient about pain relief, pain quality, and patient perception of the cause of pain. This paper describes the development of the Brief Pain Inventory and the various applications to which the BPI is suited. The BPI is a powerful tool and, having demonstrated both reliability and validity across cultures and languages, is being adopted in many countries for clinical pain assessment, epidemiological studies, and in studies of the effectiveness of pain treatment.},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {The mechanism of music effects on pain perception remains to be elucidated. To determine which component (mood or valence) of music is more important in music-induced hypoalgesia, we compared the effects of 2 melodies with different moods (happy vs sad) but with the same degree of valence (pleasant vs unpleasant) to an affective neutral lecture and a control (baseline) on the objective and subjective responses to tonic heat pain. Our hypothesis was that if mood was the key component, the happy melody would reduce pain, whereas the sad one would exacerbate pain; and if valence is the key component, the 2 melodies would both alleviate pain. Twenty females participated in this study which consisted of 4 conditions (baseline, happy melody, sad melody, and lecture). Pain tolerance time (PTT), pain intensity, and distress dynamics and the characteristics of pain were measured. A newly devised multiple affective rating scale (MARS) was employed to assess the subjective experience of auditory perception. Both happy and sad melodies of equal valence resulted in significant lower pain ratings during the pain test and were in contrast to the mood prediction. These results indicate that the valence of music, rather than the mood it induced, appears to be the most likely mediator of the hypoalgesic effect of the different music. Perspective: This article provides new evidence that the valence of music is more crucial than mood in affective pain modulation. This finding gives impetus for health professionals to manage pain more effectively in patients with proper music. ?? 2009 American Pain Society.},

This paper explores whether such constraints have left lasting marks, and whether such lingering effects potentially slow the process of democratization. Three specific questions were explored: (1) whether civic engagement in a post-communist state differs from that in an established Western democracy; (2) whether the quality of social perception suffers when civic engagement is constrained; and (3) whether a link exists between civic engagement and tangible forms of political judgment. Data were analyzed from surveys conducted in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1994 and in South Bend, Indiana, in 1984. Compared with South Bend residents, the people of Cluj-Napoca discuss politics less, engage in interactive forms of political participation at lower rates, know less about their neighbors, and fail to link the interests of people in the community to broader political judgments. Given the centrality of civic engagement to democratic legitimacy, these findings justify concern regarding the prospects for full democratization in Central and Eastern European contexts in which social interaction does not yet flourish.},

Three specific questions were explored: (1) whether civic engagement in a post-communist state differs from that in an established Western democracy; (2) whether the quality of social perception suffers when civic engagement is constrained; and (3) whether a link exists between civic engagement and tangible forms of political judgment. Data were analyzed from surveys conducted in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1994 and in South Bend, Indiana, in 1984. Compared with South Bend residents, the people of Cluj-Napoca discuss politics less, engage in interactive forms of political participation at lower rates, know less about their neighbors, and fail to link the interests of people in the community to broader political judgments. Given the centrality of civic engagement to democratic legitimacy, these findings justify concern regarding the prospects for full democratization in Central and Eastern European contexts in which social interaction does not yet flourish.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-adherence to therapy is an important cause of suboptimal blood pressure control but few practical tools exist to accurately and routinely detect it. We used a simple urine-based assay to evaluate the prevalence of antihypertensive treatment non-adherence and its impact on blood pressure in a specialist hypertension centre. METHODS: 208 hypertensive patients (125 new referrals, 66 follow-up patients with inadequate blood pressure control and 17 renal denervation referrals) underwent assessment of antihypertensive drug intake using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HP LC-MS/MS) urine analysis at the time of clinical appointment. A total of 40 most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications (or their metabolites) were screened for in spot urine samples. RESULTS: Overall, 25{\%} of patients were totally or partially non-adherent to antihypertensive treatment (total non-adherence 10.1{\%}, partial non-adherence 14.9{\%}). The highest prevalence of partial and total non-adherence was among follow-up patients with inadequate blood pressure control (28.8{\%}) and those referred for consideration of renal denervation (23.5{\%}), respectively. There was a linear relationship between blood pressure and the numerical difference in detected/prescribed antihypertensive medications-every unit increase in this difference was associated with 3.0 (1.1) mm Hg, 3.1 (0.7) mm Hg and 1.9 (0.7) mm Hg increase in adjusted clinic systolic blood pressure, clinic diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and 24 h mean daytime DBP (p=0.0051, p=8.62 × 10(-6), p=0.0057), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence to blood pressure lowering therapy is common, particularly in patients with suboptimal blood pressure control and those referred for renal denervation. HP LC-MS/MS urine analysis could be used to exclude non-adherence and better stratify further investigations and intervention.},

abstract = {The illness intrusiveness theoretical framework maintains that illness-induced lifestyle disruptions compromise quality of life in chronic life-threatening conditions and that this effect is moderated by social, psychological, and contextual factors. Considerable evidence indicates that lifestyle disruptions compromise quality of life in cancer and other diseases and that the effects differ across life domains. The hypothesis that contextual factors (e.g. age, education, income, stressful life events) moderate these effects has not been tested extensively. We investigated whether age, income, education, and/or recent stressful life events modify the experience of illness intrusiveness across three central life domains (Relationships and Personal Development, Intimacy, and Instrumental life) in six common cancers. A sample of 656 cancer outpatients with one of six common cancers (breast, prostate, lymphoma, lung, head and neck, and gastrointestinal, all n's{\textgreater}100) completed the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale while awaiting follow-up appointments with an oncologist. Results indicated statistically significant (all p's{\textless}0.05) interactions involving each of the hypothesized moderator variables and the Life Domain factor. In each case, greatest divergence was evident when illness intrusiveness involved instrumental life domains (e.g. work, finances, health, and active recreation). The findings substantiate the illness intrusiveness theoretical framework and support its relevance for people with cancer. The psychosocial impact of chronic life-threatening disease differs across life domains and depends on the context in which it is experienced.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of low back pain (LBP). METHODS: LBP was defined as pain in the area on the posterior aspect of the body from the lower margin of the twelfth ribs to the lower glutaeal folds with or without pain referred into one or both lower limbs that lasts for at least one day. Systematic reviews were performed of the prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and mortality risk of LBP. Four levels of severity were identified for LBP with and without leg pain, each with their own disability weights. The disability weights were applied to prevalence values to derive the overall disability of LBP expressed as years lived with disability (YLDs). As there is no mortality from LBP, YLDs are the same as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS: Out of all 291 conditions studied in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study, LBP ranked highest in terms of disability (YLDs), and sixth in terms of overall burden (DALYs). The global point prevalence of LBP was 9.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 9.0 to 9.8). DALYs increased from 58.2 million (M) (95{\%} CI 39.9M to 78.1M) in 1990 to 83.0M (95{\%} CI 56.6M to 111.9M) in 2010. Prevalence and burden increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: LBP causes more global disability than any other condition. With the ageing population, there is an urgent need for further research to better understand LBP across different settings.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To present the state of the science on uncertainty in relationship to the experiences of women undergoing diagnostic evaluation for suspected breast cancer.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles from Medline, CINAHL, PubMED, and PsycINFO from 1983-2008 using the following key words: breast biopsy, mammography, uncertainty, reframing, inner strength, and disruption.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifty research studies were examined with all reporting the presence of anxiety persisting throughout the diagnostic evaluation until certitude is achieved through the establishment of a definitive diagnosis. Indirect determinants of uncertainty for women undergoing breast diagnostic evaluation include measures of anxiety, depression, social support, emotional responses, defense mechanisms, and the psychological impact of events.

CONCLUSIONS: Understanding and influencing the uncertainty experience have been suggested to be key in relieving psychosocial distress and positively influencing future screening behaviors. Several studies examine correlational relationships among anxiety, selection of coping methods, and demographic factors that influence uncertainty. A gap exists in the literature with regard to the relationship of inner strength and uncertainty.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses can be invaluable in assisting women in coping with the uncertainty experience by providing positive communication and support. Nursing interventions should be designed and tested for their effects on uncertainty experienced by women undergoing a breast diagnostic evaluation.},

abstract = {Simultaneous and sequential combinations of pitches are highly meaningful in music. Simultaneous intervals are the basis of harmony; sequential intervals are the basis of melody. Sensory factors constrain preferences for musical intervals, but learning also plays a crucial role. Music illustrates the potential for harmonic and melodic intervals to interact. The capacity to extract changes in pitch direction may be a general property of the auditory system that underlies the perception of both music and speech intonation; whether interval perception is a music-specific skill remains unclear. Our perceptions of the size of pitch intervals are susceptible to a range of extraneous influences such as timbre, pitch register, direction of pitch change, tonal context, and visual signals arising from performers. Knowledge of scales permits precise distinctions between interval sizes. Because scale development depends on instrument timbres, there is no one ideal scale or tuning system. However, most scales throughout history and across cultures are predictable from the harmonic series, reflecting the prevalence of harmonic spectra in musical instruments, including the human voice.

It begins with a review of the politicisation of Hong Kong's social workers, tracing developments from the 1960s onwards. It then examines the literature on political participation in social work, particularly various typologies of political activity, in order to add to theory relating to this important aspect of social-work practice. Thereafter, it outlines the conceptual framework and methodology used in the study, the results of which provide the basis for the discussion of the political activities of social workers in Hong Kong.

abstract = {Low back pain is an extremely common problem that most people experience at some point in their life. While substantial heterogeneity exists among low back pain epidemiological studies limiting the ability to compare and pool data, estimates of the 1 year incidence of a first-ever episode of low back pain range between 6.3{\%} and 15.4{\%}, while estimates of the 1 year incidence of any episode of low back pain range between 1.5{\%} and 36{\%}. In health facility- or clinic-based studies, episode remission at 1 year ranges from 54{\%} to 90{\%}; however, most studies do not indicate whether the episode was continuous between the baseline and follow-up time point(s). Most people who experience activity-limiting low back pain go on to have recurrent episodes. Estimates of recurrence at 1 year range from 24{\%} to 80{\%}. Given the variation in definitions of remission and recurrence, further population-based research is needed to assess the daily patterns of low back pain episodes over 1 year and longer. There is substantial information on low back pain prevalence and estimates of the point prevalence range from 1.0{\%} to 58.1{\%} (mean: 18.1{\%}; median: 15.0{\%}), and 1 year prevalence from 0.8{\%} to 82.5{\%} (mean: 38.1{\%}; median: 37.4{\%}). Due to the heterogeneity of the data, mean estimates need to be interpreted with caution. Many environmental and personal factors influence the onset and course of low back pain. Studies have found the incidence of low back pain is highest in the third decade, and overall prevalence increases with age until the 60-65 year age group and then gradually declines. Other commonly reported risk factors include low educational status, stress, anxiety, depression, job dissatisfaction, low levels of social support in the workplace and whole-body vibration. Low back pain has an enormous impact on individuals, families, communities, governments and businesses throughout the world. The Global Burden of Disease 2005 Study (GBD 2005) is currently making estimates of the global burden of low back pain in relation to impairment and activity limitation. Results will be available in 2011. Further research is needed to help us understand more about the broader outcomes and impacts from low back pain. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) has become one of the principal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders. This review is based on publications using the ODI identified from the authors' personal databases, the Science Citation Index, and hand searches of Spine and current textbooks of spinal disorders. OBJECTIVES To review the versions of this instrument, document methods by which it has been validated, collate data from scores found in normal and back pain populations, provide curves for power calculations in studies using the ODI, and maintain the ODI as a gold standard outcome measure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA It has now been 20 years since its original publication. More than 200 citations exist in the Science Citation Index. The authors have a large correspondence file relating to the ODI, that is cited in most of the large textbooks related to spinal disorders. METHODS All the published versions of the questionnaire were identified. A systematic review of this literature was made. The various reports of validation were collated and related to a version. RESULTS Four versions of the ODI are available in English and nine in other languages. Some published versions contain misprints, and many omit the scoring system. At least 114 studies contain usable data. These data provide both validation and standards for other users and indicate the power of the instrument for detecting change in sample populations. CONCLUSIONS The ODI remains a valid and vigorous measure and has been a worthwhile outcome measure. The process of using the ODI is reviewed and should be the subject of further research. The receiver operating characteristics should be explored in a population with higher self-report disabilities. The behavior of the instrument is incompletely understood, particularly in sensitivity to real change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative studies implicate knowledge of cancer symptoms and attitudes towards help-seeking as important factors in patient delay. The present study uses quantitative data from a population-based survey to test the hypotheses that (a) a greater knowledge of early cancer symptoms is associated with a higher likelihood of having appraised a symptom as possibly due to cancer, and (b) more negative attitudes towards help-seeking are associated with a lower likelihood of having sought medical advice for that symptom. METHODS: Two thousand and seventy-one adults were asked whether they had experienced a symptom that they worried might be cancer in the past 3 months, and if so, whether they had seen a doctor. Respondents also completed the Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) assessing symptom knowledge and barriers to help-seeking. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-six (11.4{\%}) respondents reported having experienced a possible cancer symptom. In logistic regression analyses controlling for age, sex, and self-rated health, higher CAM symptom knowledge scores were associated with a greater likelihood of having experienced a possible cancer symptom (odds ratio = 1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.01-1.17). Of those who had experienced a symptom, 75{\%} (177/236) had seen a doctor. Higher scores on the CAM barriers scale were associated with being less likely to have seen a doctor (odds ratio, 0.74; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Better knowledge of the signs and symptoms of cancer might help people recognize possible cancer symptoms and therefore reduce appraisal delay, whereas more positive attitudes towards help-seeking might reduce behavioral delay. IMPACT: Campaigns to educate the public about cancer symptoms and reduce help-seeking barriers could play a role in promoting early diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delay in symptomatic presentation leading to advanced stage at diagnosis may contribute to poor cancer survival. To inform public health approaches to promoting early symptomatic presentation, we aimed to identify risk factors for delay in presentation across several cancers.

METHODS: We surveyed 2371 patients with 15 cancers about nature and duration of symptoms using a postal questionnaire. We calculated relative risks for delay in presentation (time from symptom onset to first presentation {\textgreater}3 months) by cancer, symptoms leading to diagnosis and reasons for putting off going to the doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation group.

RESULTS: Among 1999 cancer patients reporting symptoms, 21{\%} delayed presentation for {\textgreater}3 months. Delay was associated with greater socioeconomic deprivation but not age or sex. Patients with prostate (44{\%}) and rectal cancer (37{\%}) were most likely to delay and patients with breast cancer least likely to delay (8{\%}). Urinary difficulties, change of bowel habit, systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss and loss of appetite) and skin symptoms were all common and associated with delay. Overall, patients with bleeding symptoms were no more likely to delay presentation than patients who did not have bleeding symptoms. However, within the group of patients with bleeding symptoms, there were significant differences in risk of delay by source of bleeding: 35{\%} of patients with rectal bleeding delayed presentation, but only 9{\%} of patients with urinary bleeding. A lump was a common symptom but not associated with delay in presentation. Twenty-eight percent had not recognised their symptoms as serious and this was associated with a doubling in risk of delay. Embarrassment, worry about what the doctor might find, being too busy to go to the doctor and worry about wasting the doctor's time were also strong risk factors for delay, but were much less commonly reported ({\textless}6{\%}).

INTERPRETATION: Approaches to promote early presentation should aim to increase awareness of the significance of cancer symptoms and should be designed to work for people of the lowest socioeconomic status. In particular, awareness that rectal bleeding is a possible symptom of cancer should be raised.},

abstract = {Studies show that inducing a positive mood or diverting attention from pain decreases pain perception. Nevertheless, induction manipulations, such as viewing interesting movies or performing mathematical tasks, often influence both emotional and attentional states. Imaging studies have examined the neural basis of psychological pain modulation, but none has explicitly separated the effects of emotion and attention. Using odors to modulate mood and shift attention from pain, we previously showed that the perceptual consequences of changing mood differed from those of altering attention, with mood primarily altering pain unpleasantness and attention preferentially altering pain intensity. These findings suggest that brain circuits involved in pain modulation provoked by mood or attention are partially separable. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare the neurocircuitry involved in mood- and attention-related pain modulation. We manipulated independently mood state and attention direction, using tasks involving heat pain and pleasant and unpleasant odors. Pleasant odors, independent of attentional focus, induced positive mood changes and decreased pain unpleasantness and pain-related activity within the anterior cingulate (ACC), medial thalamus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. The effects of attentional state were less robust, with only the activity in anterior insular cortex (aIC) showing possible attentional modulation. Lateral inferior frontal cortex [LinfF; Brodmann's area (BA) 45/47] activity correlated with mood-related modulation, whereas superior posterior parietal (SPP; BA7) and entorhinal activity correlated with attention-related modulation. ACC activity covaried with LinfF and periacqueductal gray activity, whereas aIC activity covaried with SPP activity. These findings suggest that separate neuromodulatory circuits underlie emotional and attentional modulation of pain.},

abstract = {Study Design. A systematic review of observational studies. Objectives. To assess whether psychosocial factors at work and in private life are risk factors for the occurrence of back pain. Summary of Background Data. Several reviews on risk factors for back pain have paid attention to psychosocial factors. However, in none of the published reviews was a strict systematic approach used to identify and summarize the available evidence. Methods. A computerized bibliographical search of several databases was performed, restricted to studies with a cohort or case{\^{a}}€“control design. A rating system was used to assess the strength of the evidence for various factors, based on the methodologic quality of the studies and the consistency of the findings. Results. Eleven cohort and two case{\^{a}}€“control studies were included in this review. Strong evidence was found for low social support in the workplace and low job satisfaction as risk factors for back pain. Insufficient evidence was found for an effect of a high work pace, high qualitative demands, low job content, low job control, and psychosocial factors in private life. Conclusions. Evidence was found for an effect of low workplace social support and low job satisfaction. However, the result for workplace social support was sensitive to slight changes in the rating system, and the effect found for low job satisfaction may be a result of insufficient adjustment for psychosocial work characteristics and physical load at work. In addition, the combined evaluation of job content and job control, both aspects of decision latitude, led to strong evidence of a role for low job decision latitude. Thus, based on this review, there is evidence for an effect of work-related psychosocial factors, but the evidence for the role of specific factors has not been established yet. Back pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms are a major health problem in the Western world. Musculoskeletal disorders have been shown to be the largest group of occupational diseases in studies in different countries. 40 Figures of the British Occupational Physicians Reporting Activity show that of all new cases of diseases reported by occupational physicians in 1996 and 1997 nearly one half were musculoskeletal disorders. 28 According to the World Health Organization definition a work-related disorder is multifactorial, which indicates the role of physical, organizational, psychosocial, and sociologic factors in its development. 67 In occupational health research there has been an increasing interest in psychosocial factors at work during the past few years. Four explanations for the association between psychosocial work characteristics and musculoskeletal symptoms have been suggested. First, psychosocial work characteristics can directly influence the biomechanical load through changes in posture, movement and exerted forces. 25,61,63 Second, these factors may trigger physiologic mechanisms, such as increased muscle tension or increased hormonal excretion, that may in the long term lead to organic changes and the development or intensification of musculoskeletal symptoms or may influence pain perception and thus increase symptoms. 23,25,61,63 Third, psychosocial factors may change the ability of an individual to cope with an illness which, in turn, could influence the reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms. 23,25,61,63 Fourth, the association may well be confounded by the effect of physical factors at work. 23,25,61,63 It seems plausible that psychosocial factors in private life could also affect musculoskeletal symptoms through the second and third mechanism. In this article, the authors examine the evidence for psychosocial factors at work and in private life as risk factors for back pain. Several reviews on risk factors for back pain have paid attention to psychosocial factors. 9,23{\^{a}}€“25,27,30 However, none of the published reviews included clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, a methodologic quality assessment of the studies, as well as explicit criteria on which the assessment of the strength of the evidence was based. In this review a strict systematic approach is used to identify and summarize the available evidence in the literature. The method used is comparable with that applied in the clinical literature regarding the efficacy of interventions for back pain. 65 In this field, the current interest in evidence-based medicine has led to an extensive increase in the publication of systematic reviews and to the development of methodologic guidelines for systematic reviews. 64 Because individual psychological factors such as personality traits and cognitive and behavioral variables are also referred to as psychosocial factors, it is important to emphasize that this review concentrates only on psychosocial factors at work and in private life. The grouping of psychosocial work characteristics into categories in this review is mainly based on the demand{\^{a}}€“control{\^{a}}€“support model, developed by Karasek et al 36,39 and Johnson and Hall. 35 Although it is questionable whether job satisfaction should be regarded as a separate psychosocial work characteristic or as a response to working conditions such as psychosocial work characteristics and physical load at work, job satisfaction is included because many of the studies on work-related psychosocial factors as risk factors for back pain that have been performed so far focused on job dissatisfaction. In this article, a systematic approach was applied to answer the following research questions: Are psychosocial factors at work risk factors for the occurrence of back pain? Are psychosocial factors in private life risk factors for the occurrence of back pain? A similar evaluation of the evidence for aspects of physical load as risk factors for back pain has been reported elsewhere. 34},

abstract = {It is well established that chronic pain impairs cognition, particularly memory, attention and mental flexibility. Overlaps have been found between the brain regions involved in pain modulation and cognition, including in particular the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in executive function, attention and memory. However, whether cognitive function may predict chronic pain has not been investigated. We addressed this question in surgical patients, because such patients can be followed prospectively and may have no pain before surgery. In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the links between executive function, visual memory and attention, as assessed by clinical measurements and the development of chronic pain, its severity and neuropathic symptoms (based on the 'Douleur Neuropathique 4' questionnaire), 6 and 12 months after surgery (total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis or breast surgery for cancer). Neuropsychological tests included the Trail-Making Test A and B, and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure copy and immediate recall, which assess cognitive flexibility, visuospatial processing and visual memory. Anxiety, depression and coping strategies were also evaluated. In total, we investigated 189 patients before surgery: 96{\%} were re-evaluated at 6 months, and 88{\%} at 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression (stepwise selection) for the total group of patients indicated that the presence of clinical meaningful pain at 6 and 12 months (pain intensity ≥ 3/10) was predicted by poorer cognitive performance in the Trail Making Test B (P = 0.0009 and 0.02 for pain at 6 and 12 months, respectively), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure copy (P = 0.015 and 0.006 for pain at 6 and 12 months, respectively) and recall (P = 0.016 for pain at 12 months), independently of affective variables. Linear regression analyses indicated that impaired scores on these tests predicted pain intensity (P {\textless} 0.01) and neuropathic symptoms in patients with pain (P {\textless} 0.05), although the strength of the association was less robust for neuropathic symptoms. These results were not affected by the type of surgery or presurgical pain, similar findings being obtained specifically for patients who initially had no pain. In conclusion, these findings support, for the first time, the notion that premorbid limited cognitive flexibility and memory capacities may be linked to the mechanisms of pain chronicity and probably also to its neuropathic quality. This may imply that patients with deficits in executive functioning or memory because of cerebral conditions have a greater risk of pain chronicity after a painful event.},

abstract = {According to the first publication in 1993 by Rauscher et al. [Nature 1993;365:611], the Mozart effect implies the enhancement of reasoning skills solving spatial problems in normal subjects after listening to Mozart's piano sonata K 448. A further evaluation of this effect has raised the question whether there is a link between music-generated emotions and a higher level of cognitive abilities by mere listening. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that listening to pleasurable music activates cortical and subcortical cerebral areas where emotions are processed. These neurobiological effects of music suggest that auditory stimulation evokes emotions linked to heightened arousal and result in temporarily enhanced performance in many cognitive domains. Music therapy applies this arousal in a clinical setting as it may offer benefits to patients by diverting their attention from unpleasant experiences and future interventions. It has been applied in the context of various important clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer pain, epilepsy, depression and dementia. Furthermore, music may modulate the immune response, among other things, evidenced by increasing the activity of natural killer cells, lymphocytes and interferon-$\gamma$, which is an interesting feature as many diseases are related to a misbalanced immune system. Many of these clinical studies, however, suffer from methodological inadequacies. Nevertheless, at present, there is moderate but not altogether convincing evidence that listening to known and liked music helps to decrease the burden of a disease and enhances the immune system by modifying stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 S.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol), mild opioids and NSAIDs are the first-line drugs for low back pain but there is no evidence that one is more effective than the others. Non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants (with or without pain medication) could be considered as second-line drugs in acute low back pain, and cyclic antidepressants in chronic low back pain. The risk of adverse side effects can be reduced by taking account of the patient's medical history and by using a test dose. The realization that symptoms other than pain are sometimes more important and/or easier to overcome can increase the benefits of medication. The long-term effects of medication can be improved when it is combined with non-drug interventions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The methodological quality of the studies included was assessed before analysing their findings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected, seven being considered as having a low risk of bias. Information strategies were assessed by eight trials, with high-quality evidence of no effectiveness for pain, function, work issues and health care use, low-quality evidence of no effectiveness for self-rated overall improvement, satisfaction and pain beliefs and lack of evidence in terms of quality of life. Cognitive behavioural therapy was assessed by three trials, with very low-quality evidence of moderate effectiveness for pain, function, quality of life, work issues and health care use. There was lack of evidence concerning the effectiveness of individual and group education intervention or work coordination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Among the wide range of psychosocial risk factors, research has focused mainly on pain beliefs and coping skills, with disappointing results. Extended theoretical models integrating several psychosocial factors and multicomponent interventions are probably required to meet the challenge of LBP.},

abstract = {How is information about people conveyed through their preferences for certain kinds of music? Here we show that individuals use their music preferences to communicate information about their personalities to observers, and that observers can use such information to form impressions of others. Study 1 revealed that music was the most common topic in conversations among strangers given the task of getting acquainted. Why was talk about music so prevalent? Study 2 showed that (a) observers were able to form consensual and accurate impressions on the basis of targets' music preferences, (b) music preferences were related to targets' personalities, (c) the specific cues that observers used tended to be the ones that were valid, and (d) music preferences reveal information that is different from that obtained in other zero-acquaintance contexts. Discussion focuses on the mechanisms that may underlie the links between personality and music preferences.},

abstract = {Personality, psychosocial, demographic and medical variables have been identified as correlates of adjustment to breast cancer and quality of life (QoL). Most studies have examined relationships between personality, social support and adjustment to cancer in predominantly middle-class Caucasian samples, thus limiting the generalizability of their findings. Eighty-one female outpatients at a medical oncology breast clinic in a county general hospital serving primarily indigent Hispanic and African-American patients completed measures assessing demographic and medical information, health-related QoL, cancer-specific distress, mood disturbance, dispositional optimism and satisfaction with social support. Older age, receipt of treatment and greater optimism accounted for 41{\%} of the variance in emotional well-being (p{\textless}0.01). Absence of family history of breast cancer, receipt of treatment and optimism accounted for 43{\%} of the variance in functional well-being (p{\textless}0.01). Optimism and satisfaction with social support accounted for 43{\%} of the variance in social/family well-being (p{\textless}0.01). Absence of treatment (not yet treated) and pessimism accounted for 31{\%} of the variance in cancer-specific distress (p{\textless}0.01). Finally, family history of breast cancer and pessimism accounted for 48{\%} of the variance in mood disturbance (p{\textless}0.001). Family history of breast cancer and pessimism were related to mood disturbance (p{\textless}0.001). No between-group differences were found for race/ethnicity for any of the variables. Encouraging positive expectations and facilitating social support may help women in public sector medical settings cope with the stressful demands of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer regardless of race/ethnicity.},

@article{Facione2006,
abstract = {The reasons women give for delaying diagnosis of breast cancer symptoms are numerous and striking. Yet none prove reliable as indicators of those who will delay, and most women overcome all barriers to seek immediate diagnosis. This study looks more deeply into the reasoning of symptomatic women sustaining confidence in a decision to delay diagnosis of self-discovered breast symptoms. Using argument and heuristic analysis, we examined the structure and soundness of the reasoning in interviews with 28 women from the San Francisco Bay area monitoring breast symptoms. Fifteen women were sustaining decisions to delay seeking diagnosis. Their arguments' structure and soundness, and their dependence on heuristic strategies, were compared with those of women who did not delay. Prompt diagnosis-seekers used vivid stories of other women with breast cancer to explain their diagnosis seeking, and the others used similar stories to justify on-going decisions to delay. Diagnosis-seekers offered more arguments for doing so than for delay. Delayers offered fewer arguments for seeking diagnosis and many more for delay. Delayers abandoned sound and usually compelling arguments to seek diagnosis, relying instead on false information, poorly reasoned arguments, and self-created dominance structures around decisions to delay. Decisions to delay were resilient, yet required maintenance to sustain. Intervention studies aimed at decreasing patient delay should address the thinking process by questioning reliance on mistaken claims of control over possibly advancing cancer, satisficing (corner-cutting to arrive at a minimally adequate solution to achieve a goal) when scheduling diagnostic visits, simulating a benign diagnosis rather than the prevention of late-staged cancer, prioritizing fear control over protection of life. Interventions might also include challenging mistaken analogies and the too facile abandonment of sound arguments for seeking prompt diagnosis.},

The main goal of the present study was to develop and test the effectiveness of a new and comprehensive set of emotional film excerpts. Fifty film experts were asked to remember specific film scenes that elicited fear, anger, sadness, disgust, amusement, tenderness, as well as emotionally neutral scenes. For each emotion, the 10 most frequently mentioned scenes were selected and cut into film clips. Next, 364 participants viewed the film clips in individual laboratory sessions and rated each film on multiple dimensions. Results showed that the film clips were effective with regard to several criteria such as emotional discreteness, arousal, positive and negative affect. Finally, ranking scores were computed for 24 classification criteria: Subjective arousal, positive and negative affect (derived from the PANAS; Watson Tellegen, 1988), a positive and a negative affect scores derived from the Differential Emotions Scale (DES; Izard et al., 1974), six emotional discreteness scores (for anger, disgust, sadness, fear, amusement and tenderness), and 15 omixed feelingso scores assessing the effectiveness of each film excerpt to produce blends of specific emotions. In addition, a number of emotionally neutral film clips were also validated. The database and editing instructions to construct the film clips have been made freely available in a website.},

Questionnaire data were gathered from 283 Dutch same-sex mutual best friends (mean age = 12.97) in two waves with a 1-year interval. Results show consistent evidence for high similarity in specific music dimensions among friends at both waves. Moderate similarity was found in the overall patterning of preferences for music genres at both waves, even after controlling for similarity in social background. Specific music similarity in more non-mainstream music dimensions and overall music similarity at Wave 1 were related to selecting a new friend at Wave 2. However, similarity in music preferences was not related to the discontinuation of an existing friendship at Wave 2. Thus, results suggest that similarity in music preferences is related to friendship formation, and not to friendship discontinuation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, a},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better understand the severity and impact of pain in women who are breast cancer survivors.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.

SETTING: Cancer wellness clinic.

PATIENTS: Two hundred fifty-three women with a history of early-stage breast cancer who had completed therapy and were without evidence of disease. Interventions. None.

OUTCOME MEASURES: A survey that included questions about cancer history, pain, sleep problems, and physical and psychological functioning.

RESULTS: About half of the participants (117 or 46{\%}) reported some pain, although most rated its intensity as mild. Both average and worst pain ratings showed significant associations with physical functioning (rs, -0.48 and -0.43, respectively), severity of sleep problems (rs, 0.31 and 0.30), and psychological functioning (rs, -0.27 and -0.24). Age (with younger participants slightly more likely to report pain) and history of antiestrogen therapy showed nonsignificant trends to predict the presence of pain.

CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide new and important knowledge regarding the severity and impact of pain in female breast cancer survivors. The results indicate that clinicians should assess pain regularly in breast cancer survivors and treat this pain when indicated. The findings also support the need for research to determine whether improved pain management would result in improved quality of life for women with a history of breast cancer.},

This suggests that there may be neurobiological mechanisms associated with pain heritability. Because emotional circuitry is an important component of pain processing and may also influence cognition, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine affective processing and cognitive control using an Emotional Go/NoGo Task in youth with (FH+Pain, N=8) and without (FH-Pain, N=8) a parental history of chronic pain (mean age = 14.17±.34). FH+Pain youth had widespread reductions in brain activity within limbic and visual processing regions during processing of positively valenced emotional stimuli, as well as reduced fronto-parietal response while processing negatively valenced emotional stimuli compared with their peers. Additionally, during inhibition within a positive emotional context, FH+Pain youth had reduced cognitive control and salience-related brain activity. On the other hand, default mode-related brain response was elevated during inhibitory control within a negative emotional context in these adolescents compared with their peers (p/$\alpha$ {\textless} 0.05). The current findings indicate differences in both emotional processing and cognitive control brain response in FH+Pain compared with FH-Pain youth, suggesting that both affective and executive functioning pathways may be important markers related to the intergenerational transmission of pain.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psychological adjustment following cancer occurrence remains a key issue among the survivors. This study aimed to investigate psychological distress in patients with breast cancer following completion of breast cancer treatments and to determine its associated factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at three points in time: baseline (pre-diagnosis), 3 months after initial treatment and 1 year after completion of treatment (in all 18 months follow-up). At baseline, the questionnaires were administered to all the suspected patients while both patients and the interviewer were blind to the final diagnosis. Socio-demographic and clinical data included age, education, marital status, disease stage and initial treatment. Repeated measure analysis was performed to compare anxiety and depression over the study period. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that predict anxiety and depression.

RESULTS: Altogether 167 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer. The mean age of breast cancer patients was 47.2 (SD = 13.5) years, and the vast majority underwent mastectomy (82.6{\%}). At 18 months follow-up, data for 99 patients were available. The results showed that anxiety and depression improved over the time (P {\textless} 0.001) although at 18-month follow-up, 38.4{\%} and 22.2{\%} of the patients presented with severe anxiety and depression, respectively. 'Fatigue' was found to be a risk factor for developing anxiety and depression at 3 months follow-up [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95{\%} Confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.07 and OR = 1.04, 95{\%} CI = 1.02-1.07 respectively]. At 18 months follow-up, anxiety was predicted by 'pain' (OR = 1.02, 95{\%} CI = 1.00-1.05), whereas depression was predicted by both 'fatigue' (OR = 1.06, 95{\%} CI = 1.02-1.09) and 'pain' (OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.01-1.08).

CONCLUSION: Although the findings indicated that the levels of anxiety and depression decreased over time, a significant number of women had elevated anxiety and depression at the 18 months follow-up. This suggests that all women should be routinely screened for psychological distress and that quality cancer care include processes to treat that 30{\%} of women who have elevated psychological distress. In addition, if breast cancer patients indicated that they are suffering from fatigue or pain, these women who are at particular risk should be especially screened.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to evaluate the mental status of primary early breast cancer survivors according to DSM-IV criteria, distinguishing new psychiatric diagnosis, which started after the cancer diagnosis from relapse.

METHODS: A comparative study of 144 breast cancer survivors and 125 women without previous history of cancer was carried out. Neuropsychiatric symptomatology was assessed retrospectively using standardized psychiatric examinations (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Watson's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Inventory) over three successive periods, 'before cancer' (from childhood to 3 years before the interview), 'around the cancer event' (the last 3 years including the time of diagnosis and treatment), and 'currently' (the last 2 weeks).

RESULTS: Increased rates of anxiety and mood disorders were observed following a diagnosis of breast cancer compared with controls (generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD); 10.4 vs 1.6{\%} and 19.4 vs 8.8{\%}, respectively). The cancer disease promoted the development of dysthymia (n=4 new cases/6 two-year prevalent cases) and PTSD (7/7) and the re-emergence of MDD (n=21 relapses/28 three-year prevalent cases) and GAD (10/15). No improvement in serious mood disorders such as MDD (16.0 vs 7.2{\%}) and dysthymia (4.2 vs 0{\%}) was reported at the time of interview, more than 1.75 years (median time) after the cancer surgery, the prevalence being 2-4 times greater in breast cancer survivors than in controls.

CONCLUSION: Despite significant advances in treatment, a diagnosis of breast cancer is highly associated with various forms of psychopathology, regardless of psychiatric history, with symptoms persisting after treatment. These results may assist clinicians in planning mental healthcare for women with breast cancer.},

We sought to verify previously studied analgesic components and further elucidate the underpinnings of music analgesia. Using a well-characterized conditioning-enhanced placebo model, we examined whether boosting expectations would enhance or interfere with analgesia from strongly preferred music. A two-session experiment was performed with 48 healthy, pain experiment-na{\"{i}}ve participants. In a first cohort, 36 were randomized into 3 treatment groups, including music enhanced with positive expectancy, non-musical sound enhanced with positive expectancy, and no expectancy enhancement. A separate replication cohort of 12 participants received only expectancy-enhanced music following the main experiment to verify the results of expectancy-manipulation on music. Primary outcome measures included the change in subjective pain ratings to calibrated experimental noxious heat stimuli, as well as changes in treatment expectations. Without conditioning, expectations were strongly in favor of music compared to non-musical sound. While measured expectations were enhanced by conditioning, this failed to affect either music or sound analgesia significantly. Strongly preferred music on its own was as pain relieving as conditioning-enhanced strongly preferred music, and more analgesic than enhanced sound. Our results demonstrate the pain-relieving power of personal music even over enhanced expectations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL INFORMATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01835275.},

In Study 1, level of previous income was not a predictor of self-payment behavior for women or men, and men allocated more pay to themselves than did women. In Study 2, women and men did not differ on perceived entitlement when the income and work experience were made salient, but they did in the nonsalient condition, as in Study 1. Also, past income and self-pay were positively correlated for women in the salient condition. Further, when the data from Study 1 and Study 2 from the same condition (past income nonsalient) were combined, those with the higher previous income level paid themselves more than others, among both men and women.},

abstract = {Two studies are reported that tested the fear-avoidance (FA) model using path analytic techniques. In study 1, 429 employees with back pain at baseline and back pain at 18 months follow-up completed questionnaires assessing sociodemographic information, pain severity, negative affect, pain-related fear, and disability. Results indicated that pain severity at baseline predicted pain-related fear and disability at follow-up, and that pain-related fear is rather a consequence than an antecedent of pain severity. Results further revealed that the disposition to experience negative affect has a low impact upon pain severity and disability, and is best viewed as a precursor of pain-related fear. Study 2 included 238 employees without back pain at baseline, but who developed back pain at 1 year follow-up. A similar model as in study 1 was tested. Overall, results are in line with those of study 1. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical relevance and clinical implications. {\textcopyright} 2009 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.

abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY To assess quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients treated at home, at an in-patient palliative care unit (PCU), and at a day care center (DCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS QoL was assessed in advanced cancer patients at baseline and after 7 days of symptomatic treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 15-Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale. RESULTS A total of 129 patients completed the study, with 51 patients treated at home, 51 patients treated at the PCU, and 27 patients at DCC. In the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, improvement in functional and symptom scales was observed except in physical functioning and fatigue levels; patients at DCC had a better physical functioning, global QoL, appetite, and fatigue levels. In the ESAS, improvement in all items was found except for drowsiness levels, which was stable in patients treated at DCC and deteriorated in home and PCU patients. Higher activity, better appetite and well-being, and less drowsiness were observed in patients treated at DCC. KPS was better in DCC patients compared to those treated at home and at the PCU; the latter group deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS QoL improved in all patient groups, with better results in DCC patients and similar scores in those staying at home and at the PCU. Along with clinical assessment, baseline age, KPS, physical and emotional functioning may be considered when assigning patients to care at a DCC, PCU, or at home.},

abstract = {This study examined the impact of threatening information on coping and pain tolerance in a healthy adult sample. Prior to engaging in a Cold Pressor Test (CPT), 121 college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a threat condition in which they read an orienting passage warning them about symptoms and consequences of frostbite (pain as a signal for nociception), a reassurance condition in which they read an orienting passage about the safety of the CPT (pain independent of nociception), or a control condition in which no orienting passage was read before the experimental task. Only 15.6{\%} of participants in the threat group completed the CPT to its 4-minute duration, compared with 55.6{\%} in the reassurance group and 45.2{\%} of those in the control group. Even though groups did not differ on level of reported pain, threatened participants catastrophized more about the pain and reported less use of cognitive coping strategies (reinterpreting pain sensations, ignoring pain, diverting attention away from pain to other experiences, and using coping self-statements) than other respondents. A path analysis indicated that the relation between threat and pain tolerance was fully mediated by catastrophizing and cognitive coping. Together, findings suggest that pain appraised as threatening contributes to a specific pattern of coping responses associated with a reduced capacity to bear pain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective use of experimental pain in research depends on a thorough understanding of factors influencing their use. Although studies using the cold pressor task (CPT) have critically advanced our knowledge of pain mechanisms, assessment, and management in adults and children, the impact of identified methodological variability in its use is not known (ie, water temperature and apparatus); furthermore, whether methodological variations differentially impact children across development. METHODS: Pain outcomes were examined in 113 healthy children from three age groups (8- to 9-, 10- to 11-, and 12- to 14-year-olds) who completed three CPTs at different water temperatures (5, 7, 10°C) in counterbalanced order. Children were randomly assigned to one of two apparatus (ice- vs. electric-cooled) for all CPTs. Children's hand was warmed to its baseline temperature between CPTs. RESULTS: Colder water (2 to 3°C decreases) was associated with significantly higher pain intensity and unpleasantness, and lower pain tolerance and threshold. Older children (12 to 14 years) reported significantly worse pain intensity and unpleasantness as compared to 8- to 9-year-olds, likely due to longer pain tolerance. Pain outcomes in 10- to 11-year-olds fell between the other age groups, with significant differences for pain unpleasantness and pain tolerance (at 10°C). Higher pain-related fear and pain unpleasantness occurred with the electric-cooled apparatus. Girls had higher pain tolerance and threshold at all temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide critically important information about water temperature, apparatus, and child age on CPT pain responding. It informs design of future CPT studies and directs consideration of methodological variability and child age when interpreting study findings.},

abstract = {Although chronic pain and depression commonly co-occur, causal relationships have yet to be established. A reciprocal relationship, with depression increasing pain and vice versa, is most frequently suggested, but experimental evidence is needed to validate such a view. The most straightforward approach would be a demonstration that increasing or decreasing depressed mood predictably modifies pain responses. The current experiment tested whether experimentally induced depressed and happy mood have differential effects on pain ratings and tolerance in 55 patients suffering from chronic back pain. Participants were randomly assigned to depressed, neutral (control) or elated mood induction conditions. They completed a physically passive baseline task prior to receiving mood induction, then a clinically relevant physically active task (holding a heavy bag) to elicit pain responses and tolerance. Measures were taken immediately after the baseline task and immediately after the mood induction to assess the changes in mood, pain ratings and tolerance before and after the experimental manipulation. Results indicate that the induction of depressed mood resulted in significantly higher pain ratings at rest and lower pain tolerance, whilst induced happy mood resulted in significantly lower pain ratings at rest and greater pain tolerance. Correlations between changes in mood on the one hand and changes in pain response and pain tolerance on the other hand were consistent with these findings. It is concluded that, in chronic back pain patients, experimentally induced negative mood increases self-reported pain and decreases tolerance for a pain-relevant task, with positive mood having the opposite effect.},

No strategy-related differences were observed in sensory encoding of tones, as measured by the P1-N1-P2 complex. However, the contingent negative variation (CNV) leading up to the final tone of the sequence varied as a function of strategy, as did a parietal-maximum late positive component (P3b) that occurred following the final tone.

During the second immersion 1 group performed no task and the other 2 groups performed either an easy or difficult mental arithmetic task. The sensory-discriminative response to pain was measured by pain ratings. Pain ratings were collected every minute until subjects removed their arm from the cold pressor or until 4 min passed. Relative to a baseline cold pressor immersion, subjects in both the distraction conditions reduced their 1 min pain ratings more than control subjects. This effect was weaker at the 2 min pain rating and absent at the later ratings. The affective-reactive response to pain was measured by pain tolerance times. Tolerance time was defined as the time when subjects removed their arm from the cold pressor. Tolerance time was not altered by the distraction tasks. These findings suggest that affectively neutral distraction alters the sensory but not the reactive response to pain. Clinical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Musical timbre encompasses a complex set of auditory attributes and raises a plethora of musical and psychological issues. To discover the underlying perceptual structure of timbre, psychophysical approaches have used multidimensional scaling of (dis)similarity ratings to model relations among sounds differing in timbre as points within a "timbre space." The dimensions of this space are considered to represent salient perceptual aspects of the sounds based on definable acoustical parameters or perceptual categories. Timbre provides numerous perceptual cues for the categorization and identification of sound sources. As the primary perceptual result of orchestration practice, timbre can serve a form-bearing role in the creation of musical structures and musical discourse. Some auditory scene analysis processes create timbre through the blending of concurrent acoustic information, including the blending of several instruments. Others use timbre to organize events into coherent groups of events, the grouping of which can be predicted by the relative distances between sounds in timbre space. Timbre space representations also provide a model for defining timbral intervals and operations on those intervals such as transposition. Timbre can play a significant role in inflecting musical tension, and there is evidence that transition probabilities between timbres in musical sequences can be learned implicitly, opening up the possibility of creating grammatical operations in music based on timbre.

abstract = {Reassurance from physicians is commonly recommended in guidelines for the management of low back pain (LBP), but the process of reassurance and its impact on patients is poorly researched. We aimed to develop a valid and reliable measure of the process of reassurance during LBP consultations. Items representing the data-gathering stage of the consultation and affective and cognitive reassurance were generated from literature on physician-patient communication and piloted with expert researchers and physicians, a Patient and Public Involvement group, and LBP patients to form a questionnaire. Patients presenting for LBP at 43 General Practice surgeries were sent the questionnaire. The questionnaire was analysed with Rasch modelling, using two samples from the same population of recent LBP consultations: the first (n = 157, follow-up n = 84) for exploratory analysis and the second (n = 162, follow-up n = 74) for confirmatory testing. Responses to the questionnaire were compared with responses to satisfaction and enablement scales to assess the external validity of the items, and participants completed the questionnaire again one-week later to assess test-retest reliability. The questionnaire was separated into four subscales: data-gathering, relationship-building, generic reassurance, and cognitive reassurance, each containing three items. All subscales showed good validity within the Rasch models, and good reliability based on person- and item-separations and test-retest reliability. All four subscales were significantly positively correlated with satisfaction and enablement for both samples. The final version of the questionnaire is presented here. Overall, the measure has demonstrated a good level of validity and generally acceptable reliability. This is the first measure to focus specifically on reassurance for LBP in primary care settings, and will enable researchers to further understanding of what is reassuring within the context of low back pain consultations, and how outcomes are affected by different types of reassurance. Additionally, the measure may provide a useful training and audit tool for physicians. The new measure requires testing in prospective cohorts, and would benefit from further validation against ethnographic observation of consultations in real time.},

abstract = {A new measure of coping, the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ), is presented and validated in two studies of children and adolescents. Factor analyses of data from healthy children and adolescents supported eight hypothesized subscales (information seeking, problem solving, seeking social support, positive self-statements, behavioral distraction, cognitive distraction, externalizing, internalizing/catastrophizing) and three higher- order scales (approach, problem-focused avoidance, emotion-focused avoidance). The subscales and higher-order scales were internally consistent. The pain coping scales were correlated in the expected directions with children's appraisals of pain controllability, self-rated coping effectiveness, emotional distress when in pain, and among high school students, pain thresholds and functional disability. The structure and internal consistency of the PCQ were replicated in a sample of children and adolescents experiencing recurrent pain (headache, arthritis), and their parents. Relations between child- and parent-ratings of children's coping were moderate (median r = 0.34). Higher levels of emotion-focused avoidance were related to more emotional distress (both samples), less coping effectiveness (headache sample), and higher levels of pain (arthritis sample). Higher levels of approach coping were related to less disability (headache sample). Other relations between approach and distraction coping and the outcome variables were generally not significant. The PCQ is a promising instrument for assessing children's pain coping strategies. The items are simple and relatively few, making it useful for assessing coping across a wide age range. It can be administered to children as young as 8 years of age in approximately 15 min.},

Methods: Ninety-nine ASA I-II women with breast cancer between 18 and 60 years scheduled for modified radical mastectomy completed the state scale of the state-trait anxiety inventory and the Beck depression inventory before the day of surgery. Standard general anesthesia, surgery, and IV-PCA therapy was conducted. Postoperative ratings of pain intensity, opioid consumption and satisfaction with PCA were recorded for the first 24 h on the ward. The degree of pain intensity was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS, 1-10). Satisfaction with pain control was reported using an five-point scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).
Results: The pain intensity, total analgesic consumption and dose/demand ratio were significantly related to preoperative anxiety and depression (P},

abstract = {This study is aimed at investigating factors leading to delayed oncologic examinations versus immediate consultation with a physician in patients with various cancers. We analysed the results of a study of patients (n = 291) reporting for their first oncologic examinations. We conducted structured interviews containing social, demographic and clinical data, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and Harris and Guten's health appraisal scores. Based on an analysis of decision-making trees, the results indicate that it is possible to predict beliefs regarding the curability of cancer and immediate versus delayed reporting to a physician. Delayed reports may be predicted on the basis of two factors: (1) a belief that cancer is incurable combined with increased state anxiety, 'good' or 'very good' self-appraisal of health and low depression; and (2) a belief that cancer is incurable accompanied by increased anxiety and depression. The characteristics of patients delaying a visit to the oncologist suggest the existence of three independent factors leading to both considerable (longer than nine months) and minor (up to one month) delays in seeking treatment.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of listening to personal choice of music on self-report of pain intensity and the physiologic parameters in patients who have undergone open heart surgery. The study design was quasiexperimental. Patients were selected through convenience sampling in the Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care Unit at a university hospital. The study was conducted with a total of 87 patients who underwent open heart surgery: 44 in the music group, 43 in the control group, ages between 18 and 78 years. Through pretest-posttest design, postoperative first-day data were collected. First, physiologic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) were recorded and a unidimensional verbal pain intensity scale applied to all participants. Later, the control group had a rest in their beds while the music group listened to their choice of music for 30 minutes. Physiologic data were then collected and the pain intensity scale applied once more. In the music group, there was a statistically significant increase in oxygen saturation (p = .001) and a lower pain score (p = .001) than in the control group. There was no difference between the groups in the other physiologic parameters. Results of this research provide evidence to support the use of music. Music might be a simple, safe, and effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiologic responses arising from pain in patients after open heart surgery.

abstract = {The urge to move in response to music, combined with the positive affect associated with the coupling of sensory and motor processes while engaging with music (referred to as sensorimotor coupling) in a seemingly effortless way, is commonly described as the feeling of being in the groove. Here, we systematically explore this compelling phenomenon in a population of young adults. We utilize multiple levels of analysis, comprising phenomenological, behavioral, and computational techniques. Specifically, we show (a) that the concept of the groove is widely appreciated and understood in terms of a pleasurable drive toward action, (b) that a broad range of musical excerpts can be appraised reliably for the degree of perceived groove, (c) that the degree of experienced groove is inversely related to experienced difficulty of bimanual sensorimotor coupling under tapping regimes with varying levels of expressive constraint, (d) that high-groove stimuli elicit spontaneous rhythmic movements, and (e) that quantifiable measures of the quality of sensorimotor coupling predict the degree of experienced groove. Our results complement traditional discourse regarding the groove, which has tended to take the psychological phenomenon for granted and has focused instead on the musical and especially the rhythmic qualities of particular genres of music that lead to the perception of groove. We conclude that groove can be treated as a psychological construct and model system that allows for experimental exploration of the relationship between sensorimotor coupling with music and emotion.},

Trait anxiety was associated with heightened sensitivity to tamoxifen-induced symptoms (but not with tendencies to report increases in symptoms unrelated to tamoxifen use), greater tendencies to attribute symptoms to tamoxifen use, and greater cancer worry. Tamoxifen use increased BSE rates among high-anxiety participants. For low-anxiety participants, tamoxifen use increased cancer worry but not BSE rates. Trait anxiety appears to. be associated with vigilant activation of illness-related representations that trigger attentiveness to sensations, worry, and protective coping in response to somatic cues.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disease that causes widespread pain and increased sensitivity to pain because of a dysfunction in the central nervous system. This study investigated the effect of music combined with vibration on acupuncture points for the treatment of FM.

METHODS: A total of 120 patients with FM were allocated randomly to four groups (30 patients each). One group listened to a sequence of Bach's compositions. The second group was subjected to vibratory stimuli on a combination of acupuncture points on the skin. The third group (complete) underwent both procedures in a simultaneous and synchronized manner, with inclusion of binaural beats. The fourth group (control) received no stimulation. The participants underwent the experimental procedure during five sessions performed on alternate days. They were assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) before the first session and after the last session (20 days).

RESULTS: All groups showed a significant improvement in FIQ and HAQ scores at the evaluation after the intervention. The complete group exhibited the best result on both the FIQ and HAQ (p{\textless}0.001), and the improvement in HAQ score was significant (p{\textless}0.004).

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the placebo effect in FM may be substantial. However, comparison between groups revealed that the complete group had the greatest reduction in both FIQ and HAQ, with a significant improvement in HAQ, suggesting that the combined use of music and vibration exerts a greater effect on FM symptoms.},

Our audi- tory system has the task of analyzing this spectrum so as to reconstruct the origi- nating sound events. This is analogous to the task performed by our visual system when it interprets the mosaic of light impinging on the retina in terms of visually perceived objects. Such a view of perception as a process of "unconscious infer- ence" was proposed in the last century by Helmholtz (1909-1911/1925), and we shall see that many phenomena of music perception can be viewed in this way.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reduction of delay in cancer diagnosis has been targeted as a way to improve survival. We undertook a qualitative synthesis of international research evidence to provide insight into patients' experiences of recognising symptoms of cancer and seeking help. METHODS: We searched international publications (1985-2004) for delay in cancer diagnosis to identify the relevant qualitative research, and used meta-ethnography to identify the common themes across the studies. Our synthesis interpreted individual studies by identification of second-order constructs (interpretations offered by the original researchers) and third-order constructs (development of new interpretations beyond those offered in individual studies). FINDINGS: We identified 32 papers ({\textgreater}775 patients and carers) reporting help-seeking experiences for at least 20 different types of cancer. The analysis showed strong similarities in patients with different cancer types. Key concepts were recognition and interpretation of symptoms, and fear of consultation. Fear manifested as a fear of embarrassment (the feeling that symptoms were trivial or that symptoms affected a sensitive body area), or a fear of cancer (pain, suffering, and death), or both. Such analyses allowed exploration of third-order constructs. The patient's gender and the sanctioning of help-seeking were important factors in prompt consultation. INTERPRETATION: Strategies to understand and reduce patients' delay in cancer presentation can help symptom recognition but need to address patients' anxieties. The effect of the patient's sex in help-seeking also needs to be recognised, as does the important role of friends, family, and health-care professionals in the sanctioning of consultation. This meta-ethnography provides an international overview through the systematic synthesis of a diverse group of small-scale qualitative studies.},

abstract = {Neural responses are modulated by brain state, which varies with arousal, attention, and behavior. In mice, running and whisking desynchronize the cortex and enhance sensory responses, but the quiescent periods between bouts of exploratory behaviors have not been well studied. We found that these periods of "quiet wakefulness" were characterized by state fluctuations on a timescale of 1-2 s. Small fluctuations in pupil diameter tracked these state transitions in multiple cortical areas. During dilation, the intracellular membrane potential was desynchronized, sensory responses were enhanced, and population activity was less correlated. In contrast, constriction was characterized by increased low-frequency oscillations and higher ensemble correlations. Specific subtypes of cortical interneurons were differentially activated during dilation and constriction, consistent with their participation in the observed state changes. Pupillometry has been used to index attention and mental effort in humans, but the intracellular dynamics and differences in population activity underlying this phenomenon were previously unknown.},

Tolerance time, pain intensity on visual analog scale, and the pain rating index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and perceived control over the pain were measured in each condition. While listening to their own preferred music, male and female participants tolerated the painful stimulus significantly longer than during both the relaxation music and control conditions. However, only female participants rated the intensity of the pain as significantly lower in the preferred music condition. Both male and female participants reported feeling significantly more control when listening to their preferred music.

This chapter discusses research on absolute pitch drawn from a wide variety of disciplines, including music, psychology, neuroscience, and genetics. The high prevalence of absolute pitch among tone language speakers is discussed, and it is argued that if infants were given the opportunity to associate pitches with meaningful words in infancy, they might readily develop the neural circuitry underlying absolute pitch at the time.

This contrasts with findings from objective adherence measures. We argue that one of the main limitations of these self-report measures is the limited range covered by the behaviors assessed. That is, the items do not match the adherence behaviors that people perform, resulting in a ceiling effect. In this paper, we present a new self-reported medication adherence scale based on the Rasch model approach (the ProMAS), which covers a wide range of adherence behaviors. The ProMAS was tested with 370 elderly receiving medication for chronic conditions. The results indicated that the ProMAS provided adherence scores with sufficient fit to the Rasch model. Furthermore, the ProMAS covered a wider range of adherence behaviors compared to the widely used Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) instrument, resulting in more variance and less skewness in adherence scores. We conclude that the ProMAS is more capable of discriminating between people with different adherence rates than the MARS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Psychological factors including catastrophizing thoughts are believed to influence the development of chronic low back pain (LBP).
PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic importance of catastrophizing as a coping strategy in patients with LBP.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review.
PATIENT SAMPLE: This study included patients with LBP.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Work-related outcomes and perceived measures including return to work, pain, and disability.
METHODS: In September 2012, the following databases were searched: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, OTSeeker, PeDRO, PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. To ensure completeness of the search, a hand search and a search of bibliographies were conducted and all relevant references included. All observational studies investigating the prognostic value of catastrophizing in patients with LBP were eligible. Included were studies with 100 and more patients and follow-up of at least 3 months. Excluded were studies with poor methodological quality, short follow-up duration, and small sample size.
RESULTS: A total of 1,473 references were retrieved, and 706 references remained after the removal of duplicates. For 77 references, the full text was assessed and 19 publications based on 16 studies were included. Of four studies that investigated work-related outcomes, two found catastrophizing to be associated with work status. Most studies that investigated self-reported outcome measures (n=8, 66{\%}) found catastrophizing to be associated with pain and disability at follow-up in acute, subacute, and chronic LBP patients. In most studies that applied cutoff values, patients identified as high catastrophizers experienced a worse outcome compared with low catastrophizers (n=5, 83{\%}).
CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that catastrophizing as a coping strategy might lead to delayed recovery. The influence of catastrophizing in patients with LBP is not fully established and should be further investigated. Of particular importance is the establishment of cutoff levels for identifying patients at risk.},

abstract = { Examined whether or not pancultural dimensions based on general beliefs, or social axioms, can be identified in persons from cultures in 2 experiments. A Social Axioms Survey (SAS) was constructed, based on both previous psychological research primarily in Europe and North America on beliefs and qualitative research conducted in Hong Kong and Venezuela. In Exp 1, the SAS was administered to 358 Ss from Hong Kong and 203 Ss from Venezuela. In Exp 2, the SAS was administered to 114 American Ss, 99 German Ss, and 211 Ss from Japan. Factor analyses of these beliefs from student as well as adult samples revealed a pancultural, five-factor structure, with dimensions labeled as: cynicism, social complexity, reward for application, spirituality, and fate control. In Exp 2, this five-factor structure, with the possible exception of fate control, was replicated with college students from Japan, the US, and Germany. The potential implications of a universal, five-factor structure of individual social beliefs were discussed, along with the relation of this structure to indigenous belief systems and to culture-level analyses.

abstract = {These two quotations reflect common attitudes about music. Tolstoy's comment suggests that music conveys emotion, whereas Torke's question implies that music influences listeners' emotions. Section 5.2 of the present chapter includes a discussion of the various theoretical approaches that are used to explain affective responses to music. Few scholars dispute the claim that listeners recognize emotions in music. Some argue, however, that music does not elicit true emotions in the listener (e.g., Kivy 1980, 1990, 2001). For example, many years ago Meyer (1956) posited that affective responses to music consist of experiences of tension and relaxation (rather than actual emotions), which occur when listeners' expectancies about what will happen next in a piece of music are violated or fulfilled, respectively. This position has been challenged in recent years with findings from studies using behavioral, physiological, and neurological measures, all of which indicate that listeners respond affectively to music (e.g., Krumhansl 1997; Gagnon and Peretz 2003; Mitterschiffthaler et al. 2007; Witvliet and Vrana 2007). Nonetheless, the debate continues (e.g., Kone{\v{c}}ni 2008).},

abstract = {The capacity of music to soothe pain has been used in many traditional forms of medicine. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been demonstrated. Here, we examine the possibility that the modulatory effect of music on pain is mediated by the valence (pleasant-unpleasant dimension) of the emotions induced. We report the effects of listening to pleasant and unpleasant music on thermal pain in healthy human volunteers. Eighteen participants evaluated the warmth or pain induced by 40.0, 45.5, 47.0 and 48.5 degrees C thermal stimulations applied to the skin of their forearm while listening to pleasant and unpleasant musical excerpts matched for their high level of arousal (relaxing-stimulating dimension). Compared to a silent control condition, only the pleasant excerpts produced highly significant reductions in both pain intensity and unpleasantness, demonstrating the effect of positive emotions induced by music on pain (Pairwise contrasts with silence: p's{\textless}0.001). Correlation analyses in the pleasant music condition further indicated that pain decreased significantly (p's{\textless}0.05) with increases in self-reports of music pleasantness. In contrast, the unpleasant excerpts did not modulate pain significantly, and warmth perception was not affected by the presence of pleasant or unpleasant music. Those results support the hypothesis that positive emotional valence contributes to music-induced analgesia. These findings call for the integration of music to current methods of pain control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite current recommendations for women to be screened for breast cancer with mammography every 1 to 2 years, less than half of all newly diagnosed breast cancers are initially detected through screening mammography. Prompt medical attention to a new breast symptom can result in earlier stage at diagnosis, yet many patients delay seeking medical care after becoming aware of a breast symptom. METHODS: In a population-based study of breast cancer, we examined factors potentially associated with patient delay in seeking health care for a breast symptom among 436 symptomatic urban breast cancer patients (146 white, 197 black, and 95 Hispanic). Race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health care access and utilization, and misconceptions about the meaning of breast lumps were the key independent variables. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of patients reported delaying more than 3 months before seeking medical advice about breast symptoms. Misconceptions about breast lumps and lacking a regular provider, health insurance, and recent preventive care were all associated with prolonged patient delay (P {\textless} 0.005 for all). Misconceptions were much more common among ethnic minorities and women of lower socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Reducing patient delay and disparities in delay will require educating women about the importance of getting breast lumps evaluated in a timely manner and providing greater access to regular health care.},

abstract = {The present prospective longitudinal study on chronic postoperative pain was conducted to assess the predictive power of attentional and emotional variables specifically assumed to augment pain, such as pain hypervigilance, pain-related anxiety, pain catastrophizing and attentional biases to pain. Their relevance was determined in comparison with other psychological and physiological predictors (depression, anxiety, somatization, cortisol reactivity, pain sensitivity). In 84 young male patients the predictor variables were assessed one day before surgery (correction of chest malformation). Postoperative outcome (subjective pain intensity and pain-related disability) was assessed three (N=84) and six months (N=78) after surgery. Patients were classified into good and poor outcome groups. Patients with high pain intensity three (25{\%}) or six months (14{\%}) after surgery, differed significantly from those low in pain with regard to their preoperative performance in the dot-probe task (high attentional bias towards positive words). A sizeable portion (54{\%}) of patients still felt disabled due to pain after three months and a few patients after six months (13{\%}). These patients were those with high preoperative ratings in the Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire. The few subjectively disabled patients after six months could be identified in addition by low pressure pain and high cold pain thresholds before surgery. An attentional bias towards positive stimuli prior to surgery may indicate a maladaptive coping style, which avoids necessary confrontation with pain and predisposes patients to chronic postoperative pain. Lasting subjectively felt pain-related disability occurs predominantly in patients with high levels of pain hypervigilance before surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain intensity clamping uses the REsponse-Dependent Stimulation (REDSTIM) methodology to automatically adjust stimulus intensity to maintain a desired pain rating set-point which is continuously monitored from a subject's real-time pain ratings. REDSTIM blinds subjects regarding the pain intensity set-point, supporting its use for assessing intervention efficacy. By maintaining the pain intensity at a constant level, a potential decrease in pain sensitivity can be detected by an increase in thermode temperature (unknown to the subject) and not by pain ratings alone. Further, previously described sensitizing and desensitizing trends within REDSTIM provide a novel insight into human pain mechanisms overcoming limitations of conventional testing methods. The purpose of the present study was to assess the test-retest reliability of pain intensity clamping using REDSTIM during three separate sessions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used a method for testing changes in pain sensitivity of human subjects (REDSTIM) where the stimulus temperature is modulated to clamp pain intensity near a desired set-point. Temperature serves as the response variable and is used to infer pain sensitivity. Several measures were analyzed for reliability including average temperature and area under the curve (AUC). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for each measure at pain rating set-points of 20/100 and 35/100.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixteen healthy individuals (mean age = 21.6 ± 3.9) participated in three experiments two days apart at both pain rating set-points.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A bidirectional relationship between working memory (WM) and acute pain has long been assumed, but equivocal evidence exists regarding this relationship. This study characterized the relationship between WM and acute pain processing in healthy individuals using an adapted Sternberg WM task. DESIGN Participants completed a Sternberg task while receiving noxious thermal stimulation. Participants received a pseudorandom presentation of four different temperatures (baseline temperatures and individually determined low-, medium-, and high-temperature stimuli) and four levels of Sternberg task difficulty (0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-letter strings). SUBJECTS Twenty-eight healthy participants were recruited from Stanford University and the surrounding community to complete this study. RESULTS A nonlinear interaction between intensity of thermal stimulation and difficulty of the Sternberg task was noted. Increased cognitive load from the Sternberg task resulted in increased perception of pain in low-intensity thermal stimulation but suppressed pain perception in high-intensity thermal stimulation. Thermal stimulation had no significant effect on participants' response time or accuracy on the Sternberg task regardless of intensity level. CONCLUSIONS Pain perception appears to decrease as a function of WM load only for sufficiently noxious stimuli. However, increasing noxious stimuli did not affect cognitive performance. These complex relationships may reflect a shared cognitive space that can become "overloaded" with input of multiple stimuli of sufficient intensity.},

abstract = {Aim Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with a higher risk of late-stage cancer diagnosis. A number of explanations have been advanced for this, but one which has attracted recent attention is lower patient knowledge of cancer warning signs, leading to delay in help-seeking. However, although there is psychometric evidence of SES differences in knowledge of cancer symptoms, no studies have examined differences in 'cancer suspicion' among people who are actually experiencing a classic warning sign. Methods A 'health survey' was mailed to 9771 adults (???50 years, no cancer diagnosis) with a symptom list including 10 cancer 'warning signs'. Respondents were asked if they had experienced any of the symptoms in the past 3 months, and if so, were asked 'what do you think caused it?' Any mention of cancer was scored as 'cancer suspicion'. SES was indexed by education. Results Nearly half the respondents (1732/3756) had experienced a 'warning sign', but only 63/1732 (3.6{\%}) mentioned cancer as a possible cause. Lower education was associated with lower likelihood of cancer suspicion: 2.6{\%} of respondents with school-only education versus 7.3{\%} with university education suspected cancer as a possible cause. In multivariable analysis, low education was the only demographic variable independently associated with lower cancer suspicion (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, confidence interval (CI): 0.20-0.59). Conclusion Levels of cancer suspicion were low overall in this community sample, and even lower in people from less educated backgrounds. This may hinder early symptomatic presentation and contribute to inequalities in stage at diagnosis.},

abstract = {Chronic pain can be understood not only as an altered functional state, but also as a consequence of neuronal plasticity. Here we use in vivo structural MRI to compare global, local, and architectural changes in gray matter properties in patients suffering from chronic back pain (CBP), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and knee osteoarthritis (OA), relative to healthy controls. We find that different chronic pain types exhibit unique anatomical 'brain signatures'. Only the CBP group showed altered whole-brain gray matter volume, while regional gray matter density was distinct for each group. Voxel-wise comparison of gray matter density showed that the impact on the extent of chronicity of pain was localized to a common set of regions across all conditions. When gray matter density was examined for large regions approximating Brodmann areas, it exhibited unique large-scale distributed networks for each group. We derived a barcode, summarized by a single index of within-subject co-variation of gray matter density, which enabled classification of individual brains to their conditions with high accuracy. This index also enabled calculating time constants and asymptotic amplitudes for an exponential increase in brain re-organization with pain chronicity, and showed that brain reorganization with pain chronicity was 6 times slower and twice as large in CBP in comparison to CRPS. The results show an exuberance of brain anatomical reorganization peculiar to each condition and as such reflecting the unique maladaptive physiology of different types of chronic pain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low Back Pain (LBP) remains a common and costly problem. Psychological obstacles to recovery have been identified, but psychological and behavioural interventions have produced only moderate improvements. Reviews of trials have suggested that the interventions lack clear theoretical basis, are often compromised by low dose, lack of fidelity, and delivery by non-experts. In addition, interventions do not directly target known risk mechanisms. We identified a theory driven intervention (Contexual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, CCBT) that directly targets an evidence-based risk mechanism (avoidance and ensured dose and delivery were optimised. This feasibility study was designed to test the credibility and acceptability of optimised CCBT against physiotherapy for avoidant LBP patients, and to test recruitment, delivery of the intervention and response rates prior to moving to a full definitive trial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A randomised controlled feasibility trial with patients randomised to receive CCBT or physiotherapy. CCBT was delivered by trained supervised psychologists on a one to one basis and comprised up to 8 one-hour sessions. Physiotherapy comprised back to fitness group exercises with at least 60 {\%} of content exercise-based. Patients were eligible to take part if they had back pain for more than 3 months, and scored above a threshold indicating fear avoidance, catastrophic beliefs and distress.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 89 patients were recruited. Uptake rates were above those predicted. Scores for credibility and acceptability of the interventions met the set criteria. Response rates at three and six months fell short of the 75 {\%} target. Problems associated with poor response rates were identified and successfully resolved, rates increased to 77 {\%} at 3 months, and 68 {\%} at 6 months. Independent ratings of treatment sessions indicated that CCBT was delivered to fidelity. Numbers were too small for formal analysis. Although average scores for acceptance were higher in the CCBT group than in the group attending physiotherapy (increase of 7.9 versus 5.1) and change in disability and pain from baseline to 6 months were greater in the CCBT group than in the physiotherapy group, these findings should be interpreted with caution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CCBT is a credible and acceptable intervention for LBP patients who exhibit psychological obstacles to recovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN43733490 , registered 15/12/2010.},

abstract = {Background context Great effort has been made toward limiting low back pain (LBP). Recent focus has included factors involved with secondary and tertiary prevention, with less attention given to primary prevention.
Purpose This review provided a current estimate of the incidence of LBP and risk factors associated with either first-time LBP or transition to LBP from a baseline of a pain-free state.
Study design A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Patient sample Studies included subjects aged 18 years or older, from longitudinal, observational, cohort designs that included baseline risk factors to an outcome of either first-time LBP or transition to LBP from a baseline of a pain-free state.
Outcome measures Risk factors and incidence rates were reported using descriptive analysis and the PRISMA guidelines.
Methods Electronic search strategies in PubMed, CINAHL/SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were combined with a hand search to identify articles for inclusion. Studies were classified based on the population studied (community vs. occupational based) and type of LBP outcome (first ever vs. transition from a baseline pain-free state).
Results A total of 41 studies were included for review. Meta-analytical incidence rates for first-time LBP and transition to pain from a pain-free state were similar (???25{\%}), regardless of community or occupational populations. Risk factors for first-time LBP or transition to LBP from a baseline of a pain-free state were psychosocial and physically related. No consistent risk factor emerged as predictive of first-time LBP, although prior LBP was a consistent predictor of future incident LBP. Significant heterogeneity was found across studies in most models, which limits these findings.
Conclusions The results of this study suggest that incidence of LBP is similar in community and occupational settings regardless of LBP definition. There were multiple diverse physical and psychosocial risk factors for first-time LBP. A history of LBP was the most consistent risk factor for transition to LBP from a baseline of a pain-free state.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of patients with episodes of acute or subacute low back pain, seeking physical therapy in primary care, with follow-up at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between psychosocial factors and the transition from acute or subacute low back pain to chronicity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Psychosocial factors have long been thought to be associated with chronic pain only. Recent prospective studies, however, suggest that these factors may also be important in acute or subacute low back pain. METHODS: Demographic, psychosocial, and psychological baseline data were collected and analyzed from a sample of 66 acute or subacute patients with low back pain in order to predict the 3-month outcome. RESULTS: After 3 months, response rate was 85{\%} (56 patients). Forty-five percent rated their current status as "not recovered." Twelve percent reported work absenteeism. Using multiple regression analyses, baseline scores on the Acute Low Back Pain Screening Questionnaire, Pain Coping Inventory, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia were not significantly associated with non-recovery at 3 months. The only significant predictor at baseline was the subscale pain of the ALBPSQ, correctly classifying 80{\%} of the patients. The relative risk for not being recovered was 3.72 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.63-8.52) for the subjects with high scores on the subscale for pain. Pain scores and scores on psychosocial variables at 12 weeks were not associated. CONCLUSIONS: The study strongly revealed pain-related items to be essential factors in the development of chronicity and long-term disability in primary care physical therapy. Health status at 8 weeks seems crucial in developing chronicity.},

abstract = {In reviewing the evolution of research in pain, Melzack recapitulates neuromatrix theory, an idea that he developed and refined over the last quarter century while studying phantom limb pain [2,5-7]. This theory is potentially the most important of his impressive contributions to pain research because it challenges several deeply seated assumptions about the nature of pain and somatosensory perception. He asserts that, while sensory input may initiate pain or other bodily awareness, it is not the sole, or even the dominant, causal mechanism. Pain is not the consequence of a passive brain registering tissue trauma, but rather the product of an active brain forming subjective experience in response to sensory signaling. Historically and philosophically, the basic premises of this theory are not new, nor does it differ remarkably in fundamental principles from other contemporary theories of brain function and consciousness. However, neuromatrix theory is unique in addressing pain and somatosensory awareness, and it could help bring pain more fully into the mainstream of rnultidisclplinary neuroscience. Thus far, it has received much less attention and exerted less influence than either of Melzack's other major achievements, the gate control theory and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Why is this? What are its possibilities for the future? In this commentary I address these questions, discuss neuromatrix theory in light of related theories in other areas of neuroscience, and suggest future developments that may help strengthen the long-range viability of the neuromatrix concept.},

abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies. Despite these challenges, the high level of interest and multitude of methodological approaches from different cognitive domains (including music, language, and motor learning) have yielded new insights and hold promise for future progress.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel online education and coaching program to promote self-care among patients with heart failure. In this program, education and coaching content is automatically tailored to the knowledge and behavior of the patient. Patients and methods: The evaluation of the program took place within the scope of the HeartCycle study. This multi-center, observational study examined the ability of a third generation telehealth system to enhance the management of patients recently ({\textless}60 days) admitted to the hospital for worsening heart failure or outpatients with persistent New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification III/IV symptoms. Self-reported self-care behavior was assessed at baseline and study-end by means of the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale. Adherence to daily weighing, blood pressure monitoring, and reporting of symptoms was determined by analyzing the system's database. Results: Of 123 patients enrolled, the mean age was 66+/-12 years, 66{\%} were in NYHA III and 79{\%} were men. Self-reported self-care behavior scores (n=101) improved during the study for daily weighing, low-salt diet, physical activity (P{\textless}0.001), and fluid restriction (P{\textless}0.05). Average adherence (n=120) to measuring weight was 90{\%}+/-16{\%}, to measuring blood pressure was 89{\%}+/-17{\%} and to symptom reporting was 66{\%}+/-32{\%}. Conclusion: Self-reported self-care behavior scores improved significantly during the period of observation, and the objective evidence of adherence to daily weight and blood pressure measurements was high and remained stable over time. However, adherence to daily reporting of symptoms was lower and declined in the long-term.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Medical decisions concerning the prolongation of life, the right to die, and euthanasia are among the most extensively discussed decisions within medicine and law today. The responses of 360 physicians, housestaff, and medical students to a questionnaire were analyzed to identify attitudes toward these issues. DESIGN: Case vignettes were utilized to simulate the clinical context within which to survey decisions regarding whether or not to allow and assist patients requesting to die. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority of respondents (76{\%}) consider withholding and withdrawing life-support therapy consistent with passive euthanasia. Passive euthanasia is more acceptable to the majority of the respondents (77{\%}) and all three groups (physicians, housestaff, and students) are similarly more disturbed by active euthanasia. Of all respondents, 51{\%} would accede to the patient's wishes when lifesaving treatment is refused, but only 16{\%} would do so when a patient requested assistance in dying. Despite the fact that a majority (68{\%}) agree that there is a moral justification for assisting patients to die and feel "understanding" for a physician who assists a patient in dying, only 6{\%} of those persons surveyed were willing to deliberately terminate the life of a patient by administering medication to cause respiratory arrest, and only 1.1{\%} of those persons surveyed were willing to do so to cause cardiac arrest. In the case vignettes, the faculty placed their highest value on disease-based information as strongly determinative to their decisions, while students and housestaff preferred quality-of-life factors. Respondents uniformly found it easier to perform "passive" actions; they were more willing to perform "active" actions in case vignettes where patients had terminal illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Socially and legally created "shades of gray" have blurred the distinctions between withholding or withdrawing therapies and euthanasia and have left physicians without guidelines. Health ethics education should focus on case-based teaching and on reducing the uncertainty at the bedside.},

In this study, an inception cohort of men with low back pain (N = 78) was assessed at 2, 6, and 12 months after pain onset. At 6 months, pain intensity, disability, and depressive symptoms were predicted only by their respective levels at 2 months after pain onset. At 12 months, pain intensity and depressive symptoms were predicted by heightened disability at 6 months after pain onset; 12-month depressive symptoms also were predicted by 2-month disability. Pain intensity was not predictive of changes in disability or depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that functional disability plays a more prominent role than pain intensity in the transition from acute to chronic pain. A "failure to adapt" conceptual model is presented to account for these results.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether listening to music during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided 12-core needle prostate biopsy decreases anxiety, pain and dissatisfaction among patients and results in a more comfortable and better tolerated procedure. Patients and Methods: 76 male patients who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between March 2013 and June 2014 were randomized into the following groups: no music (group I, n = 38) or classical music (group II, n = 38) during the procedure. Before TRUS-guided prostate biopsy, lidocaine gel was instilled into the rectum. Patient anxiety levels were quantified using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A visual analog scale (0-10) was used for self-assessment of satisfaction, discomfort and willingness among patients to have a repeat TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Results: Demographic characteristics, mean age, procedure duration and procedure indications did not differ statistically between the two groups. The mean anxiety level and mean pain score of group II were significantly lower than those of group I (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Group II also had a significantly higher mean satisfaction score than group I (p = 0.007). Before the procedure, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were similar in groups I and II; however, after the procedure, levels were lower in group II than in group I (heart rate, p = 0.014; systolic blood pressure, p = 0.011). Conclusion: Listening to music during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy significantly reduced patients' feelings of pain, discomfort and dissatisfaction. Music can serve as a simple, inexpensive and effective adjunct to sedation during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. We recommend playing music during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. {\textcopyright} 2014 S.

A biological marker that helps to objectively define the disorder, providing information about its pathophysiology, is needed. A promising marker of cognitive states in humans is pupil size, which reflects the activity of an 'arousal' network, related to the norepinephrine system. We monitored pupil size from ADHD and control subjects, during a visuo-spatial working memory task. A sub group of ADHD children performed the task twice, with and without methylphenidate, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Off-medication patients showed a decreased pupil diameter during the task. This difference was no longer present when patients were on-medication. Pupil size correlated with the subjects' performance and reaction time variability, two vastly studied indicators of attention. Furthermore, this effect was modulated by medication. Through pupil size, we provide evidence of an involvement of the noradrenergic system during an attentional task. Our results suggest that pupil size could serve as a biomarker in ADHD.},

abstract = {Research studies of 'audioanalgesia', the ability of music to affect pain perception, have significantly increased in number during the past two decades. Listening to preferred music in particular may provide an emotionally engaging distraction capable of reducing both the sensation of pain itself and the accompanying negative affective experience. The current study uses experimentally induced cold pressor pain to compare the effects of preferred music to two types of distracting stimuli found effective within the previous studies; mental arithmetic, a cognitive distraction, and humour, which may emotionally engage us in a similar manner to music. Forty-four participants (24 females, 20 males) underwent three cold pressor trials in counterbalanced order. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task provided the cognitive distraction and a choice was given from three types of audiotaped stand-up comedy. Participants provided their own preferred music. A circulating and cooling water bath administered cold pressor stimulation. Tolerance time, pain intensity on visual analogue scale and the pain rating index and perceived control were measured. Preferred music listening was found to significantly increase tolerance in comparison to the cognitive task, and significantly increase perceived control in comparison to humour. Ratings of pain intensity did not significantly differ. The results suggest preferred music listening to offer effective distraction and enhancement of control as a pain intervention under controlled laboratory conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African-American women have the highest breast cancer death rates of all racial/ethnic groups in the US. Reasons for these disparities are multi-factorial, but include lower mammogram utilization among this population. Cultural attitudes and beliefs, such as fear and fatalism, have not been fully explored as potential barriers to mammography among African-American women.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the reasons for fear associated with breast cancer screening among low-income African-American women.

METHODS: We conducted four focus groups (n = 29) among a sample of African-American women at an urban academic medical center. We used trained race-concordant interviewers with experience discussing preventive health behaviors. Each interview/focus group was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and imported into Atlas.ti software. Coding was conducted using an iterative process, and each transcription was independently coded by members of the research team.

MAIN RESULTS: Several major themes arose in our exploration of fear and other psychosocial barriers to mammogram utilization, including negative health care experiences, fear of the health care system, denial and repression, psychosocial issues, delays in seeking health care, poor health outcomes and fatalism. We constructed a conceptual model for understanding these themes.

CONCLUSIONS: Fear of breast cancer screening among low-income African-American women is multi-faceted, and reflects shared experiences within the health care system as well as the psychosocial context in which women live. This study identifies a prominent role for clinicians, particularly primary care physicians, and the health care system to address these barriers to mammogram utilization within this population.},

abstract = {The Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) (Rosenstiel and Keefe 1983) is the most widely used measure of pain coping strategies. To date, with one exception (Tuttle et al. 1991), studies examining the factor structure of the CSQ have used the composite scores of its 8 a-priori theoretically derived scales rather than the 48 individual items. An examination of the match between the 8 theoretically derived scales and scales empirically extracted from an item analysis is lacking. Accordingly, the CSQ was administered to 126 chronic pain (whiplash) patients. Factor analyses of the individual items revealed an 8-factor structure to be uninterpretable. Of the 2-9-factor solutions tested, the 5-factor structure was the most interpretable: Factor 1, Distraction; Factor 2, Ignoring Pain Sensations; Factor 3, Reinterpreting Pain Sensations; Factor 4, Catastrophizing; Factor 5, Praying and Hoping. Eighteen Ph.D. or M.D. level clinicians classified items into their corresponding category with a high degree of accuracy (on average, 90.2{\%}), attesting to the face and construct validity of the subscales. Four subscales, Catastrophizing, Reinterpreting Pain Sensations, Praying and Hoping and (to a lesser degree) Ignoring Pain Sensations, correspond with parallel subscales proposed by Rosensteil and Keefe (1983). The fifth subscale, Distraction, is comprised of items from their Diverting Attention and Increasing Activity Level subscales, suggesting that cognitive and behavioural distraction comprise 1 rather than 2 coping strategies. That CSQ items on the original Coping Self-Statements and the Increasing Pain Behaviour subscales failed to load consistently on any factor suggests that they do not reliably measure distinct coping strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The present paper describes a theoretical model for exaggerated pain perception which has been generated from a multidisciplinary team approach to the problem of chronic low-back pain. The model is an attempt to explain how and why some individuals develop a more substantial psychological overlay to their pain problem than do others. Central to the model is the concept of ‘fear of pain' which, it is suggested, leads to differing responses in different individuals. The two extreme responses are those of ‘confrontation' and ‘avoidance', although most individuals probably exhibit a mixture of the two. The former, it is argued, leads the individual to resume an increasing range of physical and social activities as the organic basis for the pain resolves and, as a consequence, ensures minimal psychological overlay. By contrast, an avoidance strategy is thought to produce a number of physical and psychological consequences which promote the development of the invalid status and the phenomenon of exaggerated pain perception. The model suggests that the type of strategy adopted (i.e. confrontation or avoidance) is influenced by a number of psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {Selecting appropriate stimuli to induce emotional states is essential in affective research. Only a few standardized affective stimulus databases have been created for auditory, language, and visual materials. Numerous studies have extensively employed these databases using both behavioral and neuroimaging methods. However, some limitations of the existing databases have recently been reported, including limited numbers of stimuli in specific categories or poor picture quality of the visual stimuli. In the present article, we introduce the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS), which consists of 1,356 realistic, high-quality photographs that are divided into five categories (people, faces, animals, objects, and landscapes). Affective ratings were collected from 204 mostly European participants. The pictures were rated according to the valence, arousal, and approach-avoidance dimensions using computerized bipolar semantic slider scales. Normative ratings for the categories are presented for each dimension. Validation of the ratings was obtained by comparing them to ratings generated using the Self-Assessment Manikin and the International Affective Picture System. In addition, the physical properties of the photographs are reported, including luminance, contrast, and entropy. The new database, with accompanying ratings and image parameters, allows researchers to select a variety of visual stimulus materials specific to their experimental questions of interest. The NAPS system is freely accessible to the scientific community for noncommercial use by request at http://naps.nencki.gov.pl .},

abstract = {Chronic back pain (CBP) is associated with circumscribed atrophy in gray matter (GM) predominantly localized in areas of the so-called pain matrix and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous studies applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for identifying structural brain alterations related to CBP have reported inconsistent results, were limited to small sample sizes, and often did not control for medication. We therefore used VBM for high-resolution magnetic resonance images to investigate the association of CBP and regional GM volume in 111 individuals with CBP and 432 pain-free controls derived from the representative Study of Health in Pomerania, controlling for effects of medication. CBP was associated with decreased regional GM in the ventrolateral PFC and dorsolateral PFC, both the ventral and dorsal medial PFC, and the anterior insula. Pain intensity showed a weak negative correlation with GM volume in the left dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC, and anterior cingulate cortex. The CBP sample showed alterations in regions commonly associated with pain processing and emotional demands. To our knowledge, this is the first VBM study reporting decreased regional GM volume in the medial PFC in a CBP sample. We were unable to confirm alterations in regions other than the dorsolateral PFC and the insula. Perspective Previous studies reported inconsistent results for brain areas altered in chronic pain conditions, which may be in part attributable to small sample sizes, medication use, or emotional comorbidities. This study in a large and representative cohort helps to clarify these issues.},

In Experiment 1, men and women were asked to pay themselves in a private situation what they thought was fair pay for a fixed amount of work. Social comparison information was varied. As predicted, women paid themselves less money than men in the absence, but not the presence, of social comparison information. In Experiment 2, men and women were asked to do as much work as they thought was fair for a fixed, prepaid, amount of money. Subjects believed that their work was either monitored or unmonitored. Women worked significantly longer, did more work, and did more correct work than men in both public and private work settings. Furthermore, women, but not men, worked longer when they believed their work was monitored than when they believed it was unmonitored.

abstract = {While research on the association between cognitive function and pain has been continuous for decades, it has surprisingly never been a major focus of pain neuroimaging research. Sometimes pain–cognition interactions in acute pain are intuitive: pain distracts away from a task, whereas focusing on a task can reduce pain. Presumably, these effects disappear when the task becomes too difficult or important to ignore, or when pain is too intense to be kept out of mind. In chronic pain, the interaction between pain and cognitive function is more complex. Growing evidence suggests that brain networks involved in executive functions are disrupted in chronic pain conditions. The abnormal activation of cognitive circuitry does not necessarily reflect an inability to perform difficult cognitive tasks. But it does implicate a functional brain alteration that has developed with the progression of chronic pain.},

abstract = {Rhythm, as it is performed and perceived, is only sparingly addressed in music theory. Existing theories of rhythmic structure are often restricted to music as it is notated in a score, and as a result are bound to refrain from making statements about music as it is perceived and appreciated by listeners. This paper outlines a cognitive approach to the study of rhythm and timing that allows for making scientific observations and statements about ‘sounding' music, music as it is performed and listened to. This approach was developed over the last few years in the context of the Music, Mind, Machine project at the Nijmegen Institute for Cognition of Information. In addition, the notion of rhythm space (the set of all possible performed rhythms) is elaborated into a systematic method for the investigation of the relation between rhythmic structure, expressive timing and tempo. As such the paper presents a research program that aims to develop a theory of music incorporating both the structural and perceptual aspects of musical time.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that pain is a universal experience that affects human beings across the life span, serving an important protective function. Typical protective behaviors are the withdrawal from the noxious stimulus, nonverbal expressions that signal others for impending harm, and verbal utterances. Some of these occur involuntarily, as a reflex, whereas other behaviors are more deliberate. However, there is accumulating evidence that it is not pain itself, but the meaning of pain that predicts the extent to which individuals engage in these protective behaviors [1,3]. About a decade ago, we summarized the research evidence supporting the role of fear of pain in the development of chronic pain disability, presented a model incorporating basic mechanisms, but also noted a number of unresolved issues that called for further scientific attention [39] (Fig. 1). In the last decade, the number of studies on this subject has increased exponentially [21], and novel directions are being proposed [6]. Two main stances have emerged. First, although pain has intrinsic threatening features, the threat value of similar pain stimulus may vary across contexts and individuals. Second, protective responding may be adaptive in the short term, but may paradoxically worsen the problem in the long term. In the current updated review, we briefly summarize the progress made since, and highlight a selected number of remaining challenges and areas for future research.},

abstract = {Post mastectomy pain syndrome is a condition which can occur following breast surgery and has until recently been regarded as uncommon. Recent reports have suggested that it may affect 20{\%} or more of women following mastectomy. The symptoms are distressing and may be difficult to treat however treatment for neuropathic pain can be successful. This paper reports a retrospective cohort of consecutive mastectomy cases over a six year period in one region of whom 511 survivors were traced and eligible for survey. A total of 408 completed a questionnaire survey which revealed that 175 (43{\%}) had ever suffered from postmastectomy pain syndrome and 119 (29{\%}) reported current symptoms although the majority were decreasing in intensity. A striking finding was the very high cumulative prevalence in younger women (65{\%}) decreasing to 26{\%} in the over 70 year group. The details of the onset, frequency and intensity of symptoms are described along with their natural history. The age effect on the frequency of the syndrome influences the marital status, employment status, housing, and educational status of those who report typical symptoms. Body weight and height are also associated with the frequency of post mastectomy pain syndrome. Relationship between the frequency of post mastectomy pain syndrome and radiotherapy, chemotherapy and the use of tamoxifen are difficult to unravel because of the combinations of pre and post operative treatments received confounded by age. The implications of a much higher frequency of post mastectomy pain are discussed with regard to management and counselling. The high frequency of the syndrome in the younger women is important and possible explanations are explored.},

abstract = {A large body of evidence suggests that psychological factors, including emotions, beliefs and avoidant behaviours, are linked to poor outcomes in low back pain. At the same time, the evidence from trials of psychological interventions suggests that they improve outcomes mostly in the short term and against passive controls only. These suboptimal results may be due to low competency or fidelity in delivery, or inadequate matching of treatment methods with specific patient problems. Most importantly, there is insufficient theoretical guidance and integration in the design, selection and delivery of methods that precisely target known process of pathology. We identify several new directions for research and opportunities to improve the impact of psychological interventions and to change clinical practice. These include better ways to conceptualise and deliver reassurance at early stages of back pain, utilising models such as the psychological flexibility model to guide treatment development, and essentially extend the fear-avoidance model.},

Visual distraction was provided by participants' choice of painting from a selection of 15 popular artworks. Eighty participants (43 females) underwent 3 trials of cold pressor pain induction with measurement of tolerance, pain intensity, perceived control, and anxiety, and a music listening patterns questionnaire. Preferred music was found to significantly increase tolerance and perceived control over the painful stimulus and to decrease anxiety compared with both the visual distraction and silence conditions. Pain intensity rating was decreased by music listening when compared with silence. During the music condition, frequent listening to the chosen piece in everyday life was found to negatively correlate with anxiety level, and extent of knowledge of the lyrics further positively correlated with tolerance of the stimulus and perceived control. That general importance of music in everyday life also correlated with perceived control reiterates the importance of relationship and familiarity with favorite music as key to its therapeutic effect. There was no relationship between structural features of the selected music and any of the significant effects. It is suggested that preference may render music with different structural aspects functionally equivalent.},

abstract = {Upper limb fracture is a common musculoskeletal injury that can lead to marked pain-related disability. Unlike other common painful musculoskeletal conditions, such as low back pain, little consideration has been given to the role that psychological variables may play in explaining the relationship between pain and disability during early fracture recovery. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if psychological distress (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or stress) mediate the relationship between pain and disability in acute hand/wrist fractures. Self-report data from a consecutive sample of 594 patients with acute hand/wrist fracture were used. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine the role of depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between pain and disability, controlling for relevant demographic and fracture related variables. Depression and stress, but not anxiety, significantly mediated the relationship between pain and disability. That is, while each psychological distress variable was associated with pain (P{\textless}0.001), only depression (b1=0.27, P=0.03) and stress (b3=0.23, P=0.02) were significantly associated with disability, and fulfilled recommended criteria for establishing a mediating variable. Elevated depression and stress, but not anxiety, explain the relationship between pain and disability and may be novel targets for interventions designed to reduce pain-related disability after upper limb fracture.

PERSPECTIVE: This study presents the mediating effect of psychological distress on the relationship between pain and disability in acute upper limb fracture. These factors may be novel targets for interventions designed to reduce pain-related disability after acute fracture.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: According to the literature, 25{\%}-60{\%} of women treated for breast cancer, regardless of the stage, experience pain. Many risk factors have been suggested, with many possible confounding factors.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate psychosocial, surgical, and medical factors associated with chronic pain by comparing breast cancer survivors with chronic pain with survivors without chronic pain. In addition, we investigated the prevalence, intensity, and body location of chronic pain after breast cancer treatment nationwide.

METHODS: A nationwide postal survey of 1332 women who received surgery and adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in Norway two to six years before the onset of this study.

RESULTS: A total of 832 women (63{\%}) returned the questionnaires, and 41{\%} reported pain, of which 51{\%} had mild, 41{\%} moderate, and 8{\%} severe pain. Among the women who experienced pain, 33.8{\%} reported symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain. Young age (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95{\%} CI, 0.93-0.98; P {\textless} 0.0001), axillary lymph node dissection with subsequent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (OR, 1.69; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-2.67; P = 0.02), other illness that caused pain (OR, 2.37; 95{\%} CI, 1.72-3.26; P {\textless} 0.0001), depression (OR, 2.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.25-3.40; P = 0.004), and anxiety (OR, 1.83; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-2.66; P = 0.002) were associated with chronic pain.

CONCLUSION: Young age, previous comorbidities (such as back pain, arthritis, arthrosis, and fibromyalgia), and combined treatment with axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were risk factors for chronic pain. Whether depression or anxiety is a risk factor for chronic pain remains unclear.},

abstract = {Chronic pain has been shown to affect up to 60{\%} of patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Besides younger age, other risk factors for the development of chronic pain have not been consistent in previous studies. The objective of the current investigation was to detect the prevalence and risk factors for the development of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery by examining a patient population from a tertiary cancer center in the United States. The study was a prospective observational cohort study. Subjects were evaluated at least 6months after the surgical procedure. Subjects responded to the modified short form Brief pain inventory and the short form McGill pain questionnaire to identify and characterize pain. Demographic, surgery, cancer treatment, and perioperative characteristics were recorded. Propensity matching regression analysis were used to examine risk factors associated with the development of chronic pain. 300 patients were included in the study. 110 reported the presence of chronic pain. Subjects with chronic pain reported median (interquartile range [IQR]) rating of worst pain in the last 24hours of 4 (2-5) and a median (IQR) rating on average pain in the last 24hours of 3 (1-4) on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Independent risk factors associated with the development of chronic pain were age, OR (95{\%} CI) of 0.95 (0.93-0.98) and axillary lymph node dissection, 7.7 (4.3-13.9) but not radiation therapy, 1.05(0.56-1.95). After propensity matching for confounding covariates, radiation was still not associated with the development of chronic pain. Chronic pain after mastectomy continues to have a high prevalence in breast cancer patients. Younger age and axillary lymph node dissection but not radiation therapy are risk factors for the development of chronic pain. Preventive strategies to minimize the development of chronic pain are highly desirable.},

abstract = {Engaged attention, including music listening, has shown mixed results when used as a method for reducing pain. Applying the framework of constructivism, we extend the concept of engagement beyond attention/distraction to include all cognitive and emotional/motivational processes that may be recruited in order to construct an alternative experience to pain and thus reduce pain. Using a music-listening task varying in task demand, we collected stimulus-evoked potentials, pupil dilation, and skin conductance responses to noxious electrocutaneous stimulations as indicators of central and peripheral arousal, respectively. Trait anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and absorption (Tellegen Absorption Scale) provided indicators of individual differences. One hundred and fifty-three healthy, normal volunteers participated in a test session in which they received 3 stimulus intensity levels while listening to background tones (No Task) or performing a music-listening task. Linear slopes indicating net engagement (change in stimulus arousal relative to task performance) decreased with increasing task demand and stimulus level for stimulus-evoked potentials. Slopes for pupil dilation response and skin conductance response varied with task demand, anxiety, and absorption, with the largest engagement effect occurring for high anxiety/high absorption participants. Music engagement reduces pain responses, but personality factors like anxiety and absorption modulate the magnitude of effect. Perspective: Engaging in music listening can reduce responses to pain, depending on the person: people who are anxious and can become absorbed in activities easily may find music listening especially effective for relieving pain. Clinicians should consider patients' personality characteristics when recommending behavioral interventions like music listening for pain relief. ?? 2011 by the American Pain Society.},

To address this growing problem, many people are turning to mind–body therapies, including meditation, yoga and cognitive behavioural therapy. This article will review the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain by cognitive and emotional states — important components of mind–body therapies. It will also examine the accumulating evidence that chronic pain itself alters brain circuitry, including that involved in endogenous pain control, suggesting that controlling pain becomes increasingly difficult as pain becomes chronic.},

abstract = {Why do we like the music we do? Research has shown that musical preferences and personality are linked, yet little is known about other influences on preferences such as cognitive styles. To address this gap, we investigated how individual differences in musical preferences are explained by the empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory. Study 1 examined the links between empathy and musical preferences across four samples. By reporting their preferential reactions to musical stimuli, samples 1 and 2 (Ns = 2,178 and 891) indicated their preferences for music from 26 different genres, and samples 3 and 4 (Ns = 747 and 320) indicated their preferences for music from only a single genre (rock or jazz). Results across samples showed that empathy levels are linked to preferences even within genres and account for significant proportions of variance in preferences over and above personality traits for various music-preference dimensions. Study 2 (N = 353) replicated and extended these findings by investigating how musical preferences are differentiated by E-S cognitive styles (i.e., ‘brain types'). Those who are type E (bias towards empathizing) preferred music on the Mellow dimension (R{\&}B/soul, adult contemporary, soft rock genres) compared to type S (bias towards systemizing) who preferred music on the Intense dimension (punk, heavy metal, and hard rock). Analyses of fine-grained psychological and sonic attributes in the music revealed that type E individuals preferred music that featured low arousal (gentle, warm, and sensual attributes), negative valence (depressing and sad), and emotional depth (poetic, relaxing, and thoughtful), while type S preferred music that featured high arousal (strong, tense, and thrilling), and aspects of positive valence (animated) and cerebral depth (complexity). The application of these findings for clinicians, interventions, and those on the autism spectrum (largely type S or extreme type S) are discussed.},

abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To gain knowledge of how women experience pain and pain treatment after breast cancer surgery and to identify areas of pain management that they believe could be improved.

BACKGROUND: According to the literature, 20-60{\%} of patients develop chronic pain after breast cancer surgery and treatment. Because of the short length of hospitalisation in Norway, breast cancer patients are left responsible for most of their own pain management.

DESIGN: An explorative and qualitative design was chosen.

METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women who experienced chronic pain rated at 3-5 on a 11-point numerical rating scale one year or more after breast cancer surgery. This study is part of a larger, quantitative study assessing pain after surgery. The interviews were taped, transcribed and analysed according to qualitative content analysis.

RESULTS: The interviewees had expected pain in the acute postoperative period, but had not expected that pain would persist. None of the women recalled having received information about pain. They took few analgesics and were generally sceptical about medication, mostly because of earlier reactions to drugs. They received no explanations for and little help with chronic pain. Most of them were active and worked outside the home.

CONCLUSIONS: After short hospital stays, adequate information and follow-up after discharge may optimise pain management regimens. Those who develop chronic pain need more information and help to manage their pain.

RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Finding the appropriate time for information about postoperative pain management is necessary to optimise a good analgesic regimen. Multimodal and aggressive treatment of acute pain should be emphasised.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is maladaptive and influences brain function and behavior by altering the flow and integration of information across brain regions. Here we use a power spectral analysis to investigate impact of presence of chronic pain on brain oscillatory activity in humans. We examine changes in BOLD fluctuations, across different frequencies, in chronic back pain (CBP) patients (n ϭ 15) as compared to healthy controls (n ϭ 15) during resting-state fMRI. While healthy subjects exhibited a specific, frequency band-dependent, large-scale neural organization, patients showed increased high-frequency BOLD oscillations (0.12– 0.20 Hz) circumscribed mainly to medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC) and parts of the default mode network. In the patients a correlation analysis related the mPFC aberrant BOLD high-frequency dynamics to altered functional connectivity to pain signaling/modulating brain regions, thus linking BOLD frequency changes to function. We also found that increased frequency fluctuations within the mPFC were temporally synchronous with sponta-neous pain changes in patients during a pain-rating task. These observations provide novel insights about the nature of CBP, identifying how it disturbs the resting brain, and link high-frequency BOLD oscillations to perception.},

abstract = {Two analyses of patient delay in seeking a medical diagnosis are considered. In the first, a model of delay is presented. Specifically, delay is comprised of four stages (appraisal, illness, behavioural and scheduling delay intervals), each governed by a conceptually distinct set of decisional and appraisal processes beginning with the initial day that an unexplained symptom is detected to the day the individual appears before a physician. The second analysis is a social psychological one of the attributions individuals draw when relating their symptoms to their expectations and knowledge about physiological bodily processes. The eight principles of Psychophysiological Comparison Theory (PCT) provide the basis for clarifying the psychological processes of symptom interpretation and appraisal. Two studies were conducted with women seeking diagnostic evaluations for prevalent cancers: breast or gynaecological tumours. Regarding the delay model, results indicated that the delay intervals were independent (i.e. uncorrelated). Also, appraisal delay constituted the majority (at least 60 per cent) of the total delay. In the test of PCT, support was found across measures of symptoms, the context in which the symptoms arose, and the inferences people made about the symptoms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess public awareness of cancer warning signs, anticipated delay and perceived barriers to seeking medical advice in the British population.

METHODS: We carried out a population-based survey using face-to-face, computer-assisted interviews to administer the cancer awareness measure (CAM), a newly developed, validated measure of cancer awareness. The sample included 2216 adults (970 males and 1246 females) recruited as part of the Office for National Statistics Opinions Survey using stratified probability sampling.

RESULTS: Awareness of cancer warning signs was low when open-ended (recall) questions were used and higher with closed (recognition) questions; but on either measure, awareness was lower in those who were male, younger, and from lower socio-economic status (SES) groups or ethnic minorities. The most commonly endorsed barriers to help seeking were difficulty making an appointment, worry about wasting the doctor's time and worry about what would be found. Emotional barriers were more prominent in lower SES groups and practical barriers (e.g. too busy) more prominent in higher SES groups. Anticipated delay was lower in ethnic minority and lower SES groups. In multivariate analysis, higher symptom awareness was associated with lower anticipated delay, and more barriers with greater anticipated delay.

CONCLUSIONS: A combination of public education about symptoms and empowerment to seek medical advice, as well as support at primary care level, could enhance early presentation and improve cancer outcomes.},

However, the physiological processes linking cortical state and pupil variations are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that these rapid variations, during both quiet waking and locomotion, are highly correlated with fluctuations in the activity of corticopetal noradrenergic and cholinergic projections. Rapid dilations of the pupil are tightly associated with phasic activity in noradrenergic axons, whereas longer-lasting dilations of the pupil, such as during locomotion, are accompanied by sustained activity in cholinergic axons. Thus, the pupil can be used to sensitively track the activity in multiple neuromodulatory transmitter systems as they control the state of the waking brain. 1},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: National or state-level estimates on trends in the prevalence of chronic low back pain (LBP) are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether the prevalence of chronic LBP and the demographic, health-related, and health care-seeking characteristics of individuals with the condition have changed over the last 14 years.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, telephone survey of a representative sample of North Carolina households was conducted in 1992 and repeated in 2006. A total of 4437 households were contacted in 1992 and 5357 households in 2006 to identify noninstitutionalized adults 21 years or older with chronic ({\textgreater}3 months), impairing LBP or neck pain that limits daily activities. These individuals were interviewed in more detail about their health and health care seeking.

RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic, impairing LBP rose significantly over the 14-year interval, from 3.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.4{\%}-4.4{\%}) in 1992 to 10.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 9.3{\%}-11.0{\%}) in 2006. Increases were seen for all adult age strata, in men and women, and in white and black races. Symptom severity and general health were similar for both years. The proportion of individuals who sought care from a health care provider in the past year increased from 73.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 65.2{\%}-79.8{\%}) to 84.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 80.8{\%}-86.8{\%}), while the mean number of visits to all health care providers were similar (19.5 [1992] vs 19.4 [2006]).

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of chronic, impairing LBP has risen significantly in North Carolina, with continuing high levels of disability and health care use. A substantial portion of the rise in LBP care costs over the past 2 decades may be related to this rising prevalence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Behavioral symptoms are common in breast cancer survivors, including disturbances in energy, sleep, and mood, though few risk factors for these negative outcomes have been identified. Our study examined intrusive thoughts as a predictor of lingering symptoms in breast cancer survivors in the year following treatment.

METHOD: Data come from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational intervention trial, aimed at easing the transition from patient to survivor. Women (n = 558) completed psychosocial questionnaires within 4 weeks posttreatment and again 2, 6, and 12 months later. We examined intrusive thoughts about cancer at the baseline assessment as a predictor of fatigue, sleep problems, pain, breast cancer-specific symptoms, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and quality of life using growth curve modeling, controlling for study condition and other covariates.

RESULTS: Intrusive thoughts were associated with higher levels of all symptoms at baseline and at the 12-month assessment. Intrusive thoughts also influenced the trajectory of pain, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and physical functioning over time; women with higher intrusions at baseline started worse and improved over time, whereas those with lower intrusions remained at a constant, lower level over time. Intrusions were not associated with the trajectory of fatigue, sleep, breast cancer-specific symptoms, or mental functioning; women with higher intrusions at baseline started worse and remained worse over time.

CONCLUSION: Intrusive thoughts are associated with enduring elevations in behavioral symptoms and impaired quality of life in the year after breast cancer treatment and may be a risk factor for poor outcomes.},

Studies from 1958 until October 2010, investigating the association between preoperative anxiety or pain catastrophizing and CPSP in adult surgery patients, were assessed. The primary outcome was the presence of pain at least 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included; 14 instruments were used to assess anxiety or pain catastrophizing. Sixteen studies (55{\%}) reported a statistically significant association between anxiety or pain catastrophizing and CPSP. The proportion of studies reporting a statistically significant association was 67{\%} for studies of musculoskeletal surgery and 36{\%} for other types of surgery. There was no association with study quality, but larger studies were more likely to report a statistically significant relationship. The overall pooled odds ratio, on the basis of 15 studies, ranged from 1.55 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.10-2.20) to 2.10 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.49-2.95). Pain catastrophizing might be of higher predictive utility compared with general anxiety or more specific pain-related anxiety. DISCUSSION: There is evidence that anxiety and catastrophizing play a role in the development of CPSP. We recommend that anxiety measures should be incorporated in future studies investigating the prediction and transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarize evidence relating to efficacy and safety of health care interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, is not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

abstract = {Music is so ubiquitous that it can be easy to overlook the powerful influence it exerts in so many areas of our lives - from birth, through childhood, to old age. The Social and Applied Psychology of Music is the successor to the bestselling and influential The Social Psychology of Music. It considers the value of music in everyday life, answering some of the perennial questions about music. The book begins with a scene-setting chapter that describes the academic background to the book, before looking at composition and musicianship. It then goes on to look at musical preference. What aspects of music are crucial in determining whether or not you will like it? In chapter 4 the authors consider whether rap and rock are bad for young people, highlighting some of the major moral scandals that have rocked pop music, and asking whether these have become more extreme over time. The following chapter looks at music as a commercial product. How does the structure of the music industry influence CD purchasing, and how does music affect customers in retail and leisure settings like shops and restaurants? The book closes with an examination of music education. How does musical ability develop in children, and how does this relate to more general theories of how intellectual skills develop? Do musical skills develop independently of other abilities? Exceptionally broad in scope, and written in a highly accessible style by the leading researchers in this field, The Social and Applied Psychology of Music will be required reading for anyone seeking an understanding of the role music plays in our lives.},

abstract = {This review presents a general model for the understanding of pain, placebo, and chronification of pain in the framework of cognitive neuroscience. The concept of a computational cost-function underlying the functional imaging responses to placebo manipulations is put forward and demonstrated to be compatible with the placebo literature including data that demonstrate that placebo responses as seen on the behavioural level may be elicited on all levels of the neuroaxis. In the same vein, chronification of pain is discussed as a consequence of brain mechanisms for learning and expectation. Further studies are necessary on the reversal of chronic pain given the weak effects of treatment but also due to alarming findings that suggest morphological changes in the brain pain regulatory systems concurrent with the chronification process. The burden of chronic pain is devastating both on the individual level and society level and affects more than one-quarter of the world's population. Women are greatly overrepresented in patients with chronic pain. Hence, both from a general standpoint and from reasons of health equity, it is of essence to advance research and care efforts. Success in these efforts will only be granted with better theoretical concepts of chronic pain mechanisms that maps into the framework of cognitive neuroscience.},

abstract = {Objective: Assessment of the analgesic effect of an agent in an experimental pain model permits a level of control not possible in a clinical pain setting and is an ideal approach for evaluation of analgesic drugs. The aim of the present study was to establish a simple and reliable method of producing experimental pain, which can be used for screening of various analgesic agents. Materials and Methods: The standardized method was followed in all cases, by recording thermal pain threshold in seconds in 24 healthy volunteers using hot air source at two different speeds, which is equipped in an acrylic-made chamber adjustable to three different levels. Reproducibility of the test procedure was evaluated by recording the thermal threshold parameter by a single observer on two sessions (interday reproducibility) and second observer on one session (interobserver reproducibility) separately. Validity of model was further tested by evaluating the analgesic effect of tramadol on 12 healthy volunteers. Results: Thermal pain model was found to produce low variability with coefficient of variation (CV) less than 10{\%}. Interobserver and interday reproducibility were very good, as shown by Bland--Altman plot, with most of the values within ± 2SD. There was a significant increase in pain threshold time with use of tramadol as compared to placebo which was statistically significant ( P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: The newly developed pain model offers a stable and sensitive method for the early assessment of analgesic activity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that pain can affect cognitive processes, but the cortical networks involved in pain-cognition interactions are unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of pain on the activity of cortical areas involved in cognition acting as a whole (i.e., a network). Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while engaged in an attention-demanding cognitive task (multisource interference task) of varying difficulty and simultaneously receiving painful stimuli at varying intensities. The control (baseline) condition was simple finger tapping that had minimal cognitive demands and without pain. Functional connectivity analysis revealed a cortical network consisting of two anti-correlated parts: a task-negative part (precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal and inferior parietal/temporal) the activity of which correlated negatively with the cognitive task and positively with the control baseline, and a task-positive part (inferior frontal, superior parietal, premotor, and anterior insula cortices) the activity of which correlated positively with the cognitive task and negatively with the baseline. Independent components analysis revealed these opposing networks were operating at a low frequency (0.03-0.08 Hz). The functional connectivity of the task-positive network was increased by cognitive demand and by pain. We suggest this attention-specific network balances the needs of general self-referential and environmental awareness versus focused attention to salient information. We postulate that pain affects cognitive ability by its reliance on this common attention-specific network. These data provide evidence that pain can modulate a network presumed to be involved in focused attention, suggesting a mechanism for the interference of pain on cognitive ability by the consumption of attentional resources.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of demographic characteristics, breast cancer knowledge, fatalistic beliefs, health beliefs, and subjective norms on Jordanian women's intention to participate in mammography screening. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data at 14 comprehensive healthcare centers in Amman and Zarqa, Jordan. A convenience sample of 142 Jordanian women 40 years of age or older with no history of breast cancer and able to read and write in Arabic participated. METHODS: Self-report surveys included a combination of researcher-designed and existing instruments to measure the study variables. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, t tests, and multiple logistic regression. FINDINGS: Jordanian women surveyed lacked knowledge about breast cancer. Social norms and self-efficacy highly influenced these women's intention to engage in mammography screening. Younger women were more willing to indicate intention to engage in mammographic screening. CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy and the social connectedness of Jordanian society, but not religious beliefs or perceived barriers to screening, influence Jordanian women's intention to undergo mammography. Future research should examine cultural influences, rather than religious beliefs, and investigate Jordanian women's potentially unique perspectives on barriers to actual mammography screening behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevalence of mammography screening may be enhanced by focusing interventions on Jordanian women's support systems and empowering women by providing knowledge and skills needed to engage in the procedure.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of interdependence on anxiety within dyads where one person was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Perceptions of relationship quality were expected to mitigate the anxiety experienced by both members of the dyad. 96 dyads participated in a 3-wave longitudinal study that took place over 10 weeks. Dyads were composed of a woman with stage I-III breast cancer who was currently undergoing treatment, and a partner who she nominated to participate in the study along with her. Results indicated that anxiety felt by women with breast cancer was consistently associated with that of her partner. Structural equation analyses suggest that the within-dyad influence runs mostly from partners' anxiety to the anxiety of women with breast cancer. Partners' anxiety was also associated with other indicators of the women's well being including depression, fatigue, and symptom management. Perceptions of relationship quality from women with breast cancer and their partners were negatively associated with partners' anxiety. However, women's anxiety was only correlated with their partners', but not their own, perceptions of relationship quality. These findings underscore the benefit of having partners who are able to cope with or get help for their own personal distress as women cope with the stress of breast cancer and its treatment.},

abstract = {Background Context Chronic low back pain is debilitating and difficult to treat. Depending on the etiology, responses to treatments vary widely. Although chronic low back pain is frequently related to intervertebral disc degeneration, the relationship between disc degeneration severity and clinical symptoms are still poorly understood. In humans, studies investigating the relationship between disc degeneration severity and low back pain are limited by the difficulty of obtaining disc samples from well-characterized patients and pain-free controls. We have previously described the secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine (SPARC)-null mouse model of chronic low back pain. SPARC is a matricellular protein involved in regulating the assembly and composition of extracellular matrix. The SPARC-null mice develop age-dependent disc degeneration of increasing severity accompanied by behavioral signs suggestive of axial low back pain, radiating leg pain, and motor impairment. The existence of this model allows for examination of the relationships between clinical symptoms in vivo and pathological signs of disc degeneration ex vivo. Purpose The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between behavioral signs of pain and the severity of lumbar disc degeneration using the SPARC-null mouse model of disc degeneration-related low back pain. Study Design This study used a cross-sectional, multiple-cohort behavioral and histological study of disc degeneration and behavioral symptoms in a mouse model of low back pain associated with disc degeneration. Methods SPARC-null and wild-type control mice ranging from 6 to 78 weeks of age were used in this study. The severity of disc degeneration was determined by ex vivo analysis of the lumbar spine using colorimetric histological staining and a scoring system adapted from the Pfirrmann scale. Behavioral signs of axial low back pain, radiating leg pain, and motor impairment were quantified as tolerance to axial stretching in the grip force assay, hypersensitivity to cold or mechanical stimuli on the hindpaw (acetone and von Frey tests), and latency to fall in the rotarod assay, respectively. Results The SPARC-null mice exhibited decreased tolerance to axial stretching, hindpaw cold hypersensitivity, and motor impairment compared with age-matched control mice. The severity of disc degeneration increased with age in both SPARC-null and control mice and by 78 weeks of age, the same proportion of lumbar discs were abnormal in SPARC-null and control mice. However, the degree of degeneration was more severe in the SPARC-null mice. In both SPARC-null and control mice, tolerance to axial stretching but not hindpaw cold sensitivity correlated with disc degeneration severity. Motor impairment correlated with degeneration severity in the SPARC-null mice only. Conclusions These data suggest that internal disc disruption contributes to axial low back pain and motor impairment but not to radiating leg pain. These results have implications for the optimization of mechanism-based treatments strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The fear-avoidance (FA) model of chronic pain describes how individuals experiencing acute pain may become trapped into a vicious circle of chronic disability and suffering. We propose to extend the FA model by adopting a motivational perspective on chronic pain and disability. METHODS: A narrative review. RESULTS: There is ample evidence to support the validity of the FA model as originally formulated. There are, however, some key challenges that call for a next generation of the FA model. First, the FA model has its roots in psychopathology, and investigators will have to find a way to account for findings that do not easily fit within such framework. Second, the FA model needs to address the dynamics and complexities of disability and functional recovery. Third, the FA model should incorporate the idea that pain-related fear and avoidance occurs in a context of multiple and often competing personal goals. DISCUSSION: To address these 3 key challenges, we argue that the next generation of the FA model needs to more explicitly adopt a motivational perspective, one that is built around the organizing powers of goals and self-regulatory processes.

abstract = {In an attempt to explain how and why some individuals with musculoskeletal pain develop a chronic pain syndrome, Lethem et al.(Lethem J, Slade PD, Troup JDG, Bentley G. Outline of fear-avoidance model of exaggerated pain perceptions. Behav Res Ther 1983; 21: 401-408).ntroduced a so-called 'fear-avoidance' model. The central concept of their model is fear of pain. 'Confrontation' and 'avoidance' are postulated as the two extreme responses to this fear, of which the former leads to the reduction of fear over time. The latter, however, leads to the maintenance or exacerbation of fear, possibly generating a phobic state. In the last decade, an increasing number of investigations have corroborated and refined the fear-avoidance model. The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence for the mediating role of pain-related fear, and its immediate and long-term consequences in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain disability. We first highlight possible precursors of pain-related fear including the role negative appraisal of internal and external stimuli, negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity may play. Subsequently, a number of fear-related processes will be discussed including escape and avoidance behaviors resulting in poor behavioral performance, hypervigilance to internal and external illness information, muscular reactivity, and physical disuse in terms of deconditioning and guarded movement. We also review the available assessment methods for the quantification of pain-related fear and avoidance. Finally, we discuss the implications of the recent findings for the prevention and treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although there are still a number of unresolved issues which merit future research attention, pain-related fear and avoidance appear to be an essential feature of the development of a chronic problem for a substantial number of patients with musculoskeletal pain.

We first consider musical development as it occurs in a social context, beginning with interactions between parents and infants. We then examine how children become enculturated listeners through everyday experiences, developing brain circuits specialized for the pitch, rhythmic, and emotional structures of their culture's music. We review the development of singing production, from infants' initial cooing to the high degree of sensorimotor coordination achieved by accurate singers. Last, we consider the effects of formal musical training on musical development as well as on other cognitive domains such as language and mathematics. Across these domains, there is evidence for some very early-developing, perhaps innate, abilities. At the same time, developmental trajectories are protracted, with adult levels not achieved for many years. Finally, there is much evidence that particular musical experience and formal training have large effects on musical outcome.

abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disorder of unknown aetiology, characterized by chronic widespread pain, stiffness and sleep disturbances. In addition, patients frequently complain of memory and attention deficits. Accumulating evidence suggests that FM is associated with CNS dysfunction and with an altered brain morphology. However, few studies have specifically investigated neuropsychological issues in patients suffering from FM. We therefore sought to determine whether neuropsychological deficits found in FM patients may be correlated with changes in local brain morphology specifically in the frontal, temporal or cingulate cortices. Twenty FM patients underwent extensive testing for potential neuropsychological deficits, which demonstrated significantly reduced working memory and impaired non-verbal long-term memory (limited to free recall condition) in comparison with normative data from age- and education-matched control groups. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate for potential correlations between test results and local brain morphology. Performance on non-verbal working memory was positively correlated with grey matter values in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas performance on verbal working memory (digit backward) was positively correlated with grey matter values in the supplementary motor cortex. On the other hand, pain scores were negatively correlated with grey matter values in the medial frontal gyrus. White matter analyses revealed comparable correlations for verbal working memory and pain scores in the medial frontal and prefrontal cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex. Our data suggest that, in addition to chronic pain, FM patients suffer from neurocognitive deficits that correlate with local brain morphology in the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate gyrus, which may be interpreted to indicate structural correlates of pain-cognition interaction.},

abstract = {There is overwhelming anecdotal and empirical evidence for individual differences in musical preferences. However, little is known about what drives those preferences. Are people drawn to particular musical genres (e.g., rap, jazz) or to certain musical properties (e.g., lively, loud)? Recent findings suggest that musical preferences can be conceptualized in terms of five orthogonal dimensions: Mellow, Unpretentious, Sophisticated, Intense, and Contemporary (conveniently, MUSIC). The aim of the present research is to replicate and extend that work by empirically examining the hypothesis that musical preferences are based on preferences for particular musical properties and psychological attributes as opposed to musical genres. Findings from Study 1 replicated the five-factor MUSIC structure using musical excerpts from a variety of genres and subgenres and revealed musical attributes that differentiate each factor. Results from Studies 2 and 3 show that the MUSIC structure is recoverable using musical pieces from only the jazz and rock genres, respectively. Taken together, the current work provides strong evidence that preferences for music are determined by specific musical attributes and that the MUSIC model is a robust framework for conceptualizing and measuring such preferences.},

METHOD: Eighty-nine children aged 2 months to 7 years, (3.0 +/- 2.0 yrs.) who had undergone a variety of surgical procedures, were observed in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). The study consisted of: 1) measuring interrater reliability; 2) testing validity by measuring changes in FLACC scores in response to administration of analgesics; and 3) comparing FLACC scores to other pain ratings. FINDINGS: The FLACC tool was found to have high interrater reliability. Preliminary evidence of validity was provided by the significant decrease in FLACC scores related to administration of analgesics. Validity was also supported by the correlation with scores assigned by the Objective Pain Scale (OPS) and nurses' global ratings of pain. CONCLUSIONS: The FLACC provides a simple framework for quantifying pain behaviors in children who may not be able to verbalize the presence or severity of pain. Our preliminary data indicates the FLACC pain assessment tool is valid and reliable.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: In studies of cognitive processing using tasks with externally directed attention, regions showing increased (external-task-positive) and decreased or "negative" [default-mode network (DMN)] fMRI responses during task performance are dynamically responsive to increasing task difficulty. Responsiveness (modulation of fMRI signal by increasing load) has been linked directly to successful cognitive task performance in external-task-positive regions but not in DMN regions. To investigate whether a responsive DMN is required for successful cognitive performance, we compared healthy human subjects (n = 23) with individuals shown to have decreased DMN engagement (chronic pain patients, n = 28). Subjects performed a multilevel working-memory task (N-back) during fMRI. If a responsive DMN is required for successful performance, patients having reduced DMN responsiveness should show worsened performance; if performance is not reduced, their brains should show compensatory activation in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. All subjects showed decreased accuracy and increased reaction times with increasing task level, with no significant group differences on either measure at any level. Patients had significantly reduced negative fMRI response (deactivation) of DMN regions (posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Controls showed expected modulation of DMN deactivation with increasing task difficulty. Patients showed significantly reduced modulation of DMN deactivation by task difficulty, despite their successful task performance. We found no evidence of compensatory neural recruitment in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. Individual responsiveness of the external-task-positive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but not of DMN regions, correlated with task accuracy. These findings suggest that a responsive DMN may not be required for successful cognitive performance; a responsive external-task-positive network may be sufficient.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We studied the relationship between responsiveness of the brain to increasing task demand and successful cognitive performance, using chronic pain patients as a probe. fMRI working memory studies show that two main cognitive networks ["external-task positive" and "default-mode network" (DMN)] are responsive to increasing task difficulty. The responsiveness of both of these brain networks is suggested to be required for successful task performance. The responsiveness of external-task-positive regions has been linked directly to successful cognitive task performance, as we also show here. However, pain patients show decreased engagement and responsiveness of the DMN but can perform a working memory task as well as healthy subjects, without demonstrable compensatory neural recruitment. Therefore, a responsive DMN might not be needed for successful cognitive performance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe the meaning of cancer pain and attitudes in dealing with cancer pain among a group of African Americans with cancer.

RESEARCH APPROACH: Qualitative descriptive design.

SETTING: Three outpatient medical oncology clinics in the mid-Atlantic region.

PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of 35 self-identified African Americans older than age 18 and diagnosed with solid tumors, with self-reported cancer-related pain lasting at least one month in duration and no major surgery in the previous three months.

METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: In-depth, semistructured, taped-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed. Initial codes were categorized into meaningful themes, and the data were analyzed until no new themes emerged.

FINDINGS: Cancer pain was articulated by participants in terms of its physical, emotional, and existential dimensions. Themes related to cancer and pain remained intertwined. Some participants viewed pain as a signal of underlying disease progression and described it as a monitoring strategy for staying ahead of their cancer. Stoicism, faith, and finding meaning in the cancer pain experience emerged as main themes in participants dealing with cancer pain.

CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that perceived meanings and interpretations of the nature of cancer pain, its causes, and consequences may be important in shaping participants' pain treatment negotiations with providers. Understanding patient-level factors is crucial to fully comprehend pain treatment disparities.

INTERPRETATION: Providers must assume a more proactive role in assessing physical, emotional, and existential dimensions of cancer pain, improving trust and communication, and identifying educational and behavioral interventions for African American patients and families to optimize pain treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {This study assessed motor limits of regular tapping, timing error detection, and correction in 60 participants aged from 19 to 98 years. Rate limitations on motor production were estimated from the average inter-tap interval when tapping as fast as possible for 30 s. Timing error detection required participants to judge whether a sound sequence presented at a slow, intermediate, or fast speed contained an irregularity because of phase shift. This was performed with or without synchronizing to the sounds. On the basis of the just-detectable positive phase shift (JND), participants synchronized with sequences containing phase shifts that were subliminal, just detectable or supraliminal. On average, JNDs were 9{\%} of the inter-onset interval and by and large were not affected by synchronization tapping. Speed of error correction was estimated from the number of tones to return within 20{\%} of the preshift synchronization error. Consistent with previous findings of motor slowing with aging, the fastest inter-tap interval increased with age. However, there was no age-related decline in JNDs or speed of error correction, both of which reflect predictive abilities for intervals within the motor repertoire of human adults. These results point towards intact timing error processing up to an advanced age. In assessing timing abilities in the brain of older adults, it is important to differentiate between motor slowing and its impact on rhythmic behavior (e.g., walking pace) from anticipatory mechanisms ('what to expect when') and how these are used to adjust the timing of actions ('what to do when').},

abstract = {Individuals typically believe that they are less likely than the average person to experience negative events, a phenomenon termed "unrealistic optimism". The direct method of assessing unrealistic optimism employs a question of the form, "Compared with the average person, what is the chance that X will occur to you?". However, it has been proposed that responses to such a question (direct-estimates) are based essentially just on estimates that X will occur to the self (self-estimates). If this is so, any factors that affect one of these estimates should also affect the other. This prediction was tested in two experiments. In each, direct- and self-estimates for an unfamiliar health threat - homocysteine-related heart problems - were recorded. It was found that both types of estimate were affected in the same way by varying the stated probability of having unsafe levels of homocysteine (Study 1, N=149) and varying the stated probability that unsafe levels of homocysteine will lead to heart problems (Study 2, N=111). The results are consistent with the proposal that direct-estimates are constructed just from self-estimates.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN A prospective survey of patients seeking primary care for low back pain. Clinical and psychosocial data, available at presentation, were explored for predictors of outcome at 1 year. OBJECTIVES To determine the relative value of clinical and psychosocial variables for early identification of patients with a poor prognosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Current treatment strategies for low back pain have failed to stem the rising levels of disability. Psychosocial factors have been shown to be important determinants of response to therapy in chronic patients, but the contribution from similar data in acute or subchronic patients has not been comprehensively investigated. METHODS Two hundred fifty-two patients with low back pain, presenting to primary care, underwent a structured clinical interview and completed a battery of psychosocial instruments. Follow-up was done by mail at 1 year; outcome was measured using a back pain disability questionnaire. Predictive relationships were sought between the data at presentation and disability at follow-up. RESULTS Most patients showed improved disability and pain scores, although more than half had persisting symptoms. Eighteen percent showed significant psychological distress at presentation. Multiple regression analysis showed the level of persisting disability to depend principally on measures in the psychosocial domain; for acute cases outcome is also dependent on the absence or presence of a previous history of low back trouble. Discriminant models successfully allocated typically 76{\%} of cases to recovered/not-recovered groups, largely on the basis of psychosocial factors evident at presentation. CONCLUSIONS Early identification of psychosocial problems is important in understanding, and hopefully preventing, the progression to chronicity in low back trouble.},

This impairment represents a major obstacle to daily activities and rehabilitation, especially in the chronic pain population. Here we review clinical and preclinical studies that have investigated pain-related alterations in cognition. These include impaired attentional, executive and general cognitive functioning. We describe the anatomical, neurochemical and molecular substrates common to both cognitive processing and supraspinal pain processing, and present the evidence for their involvement in pain-related cognitive impairment. We also examine the added complexity of cognitive impairment caused by analgesic medications and how this can further impact on morbidity in chronic pain patients. The need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of both pain-induced and treatment-related cognitive impairment is highlighted. Further research in this area will aid our understanding of patient symptoms and their underlying pathophysiology, ultimately leading to increased provision of guided therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Data from 2 large cross-sectional studies involving more than a quarter of a million individuals were used to investigate age differences in musical attitudes and preferences from adolescence through middle age. Study 1 investigated age trends in musical engagement. Results indicated that (a) the degree of importance attributed to music declines with age but that adults still consider music important, (b) young people listen to music significantly more often than do middle-aged adults, and (c) young people listen to music in a wide variety of contexts, whereas adults listen to music primarily in private contexts. Study 2 examined age trends in musical preferences. Results indicated that (a) musical preferences can be conceptualized in terms of a 5-dimensional age-invariant model, (b) certain music-preference dimensions decrease with age (e.g., Intense, Contemporary), whereas preferences for other music dimensions increase with age (e.g., Unpretentious, Sophisticated), and (c) age trends in musical preferences are closely associated with personality. Normative age trends in musical preferences corresponded with developmental changes in psychosocial development, personality, and auditory perception. Overall, the findings suggest that musical preferences are subject to a variety of developmental influences throughout the life span.},

Out of 100 factors documented at the one-month assessment, measures of somatization, depression, functional limitations, and pain were the strongest predictors of two-year modified Roland-Morris score among a random subsample of 569 subjects. A multiple regression model containing the Symptom Checklist Depression and Somatization scores, the one-month modified Roland-Morris score and the number of pain days in the past six months explained about 30{\%} of the variance in the outcome. Using recursive partitioning, a very simple model was developed to identify patients at high risk of sustaining long-term significant functional limitations. The regression model and the recursive partitioning model were successfully tested in a fresh sample of patients (n = 644). Clinical application of the recursive partitioning model and methodological aspects of this study are discussed.},

Subjects and methods A total of 137 veteran patients receiving routine urologic care in a North American Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system were recruited over a two-year period (June 2011 to June 2013). All patients were prospectively randomized to undergo office-based flexible cystoscopy with or without music. The music group consisted of 73 patients who listened to the same excerpt of classical music at time of flexible cystoscopy, and the non-music group consisted of 64 patients. Results The median post-procedural STAI anxiety scores between the music and non-music groups were statistically significant different: 30 (range 23-39) and 35 (range 28-49), respectively (p=0.0017). The median post-procedural pain VAS score between the music and non-music groups reached statistical significance: 0 (range 0-1) and 2 (range 1-2), respectively (p{\textless}0.0001). The median delta STAI anxiety score was statistically significantly different between the music and non-music groups: 0 (range -3-0) and 2 (range 0-4), respectively (p{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions This study demonstrates that listening to music decreases anxiety and pain associated with flexible cystoscopy in a North American VA patient population. We recommend incorporating music as an effective adjunct to other maneuvers utilized at time of flexible cystoscopy to reduce anxiety and pain.},

abstract = {Literature is reviewed indicating that greater tendency to manage anger via direct verbal or physical expression (trait anger-out) is associated with increased acute and chronic pain responsiveness. Neuroimaging data are overviewed supporting overlapping neural circuits underlying regulation of both pain and anger, consisting of brain regions including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. These circuits provide a potential neural basis for observed positive associations between anger-out and pain responsiveness. The role of endogenous opioids in modulating activity in these interlinked brain regions is explored, and implications for understanding pain-related effects of anger-out are described. An opioid dysfunction hypothesis is presented in which inadequate endogenous opioid inhibitory activity in these brain regions contributes to links between trait anger-out and pain. A series of studies is presented that supports the opioid dysfunction hypothesis, further suggesting that gender and genetic factors may moderate these effects. Finally, possible implications of interactions between trait anger-out and state behavioral anger expression on endogenous opioid analgesic activity are described.},

However, we recently found that sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) error detection and correction abilities are preserved into the ninth and tenth decades, although fastest tapping rate decreases (Turgeon, Wing, {\&} Taylor, 2011). Further testing with the same sample of participants in the present study provides evidence for slowing of the internal clock with age. We report an age-related decrease in spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), an age-related increase in produced period when estimating target durations of 500 ms and 1000 ms, and an age-related increase in "clock variance" in continuing tapping intervals ranging from 300 ms to 900 ms. The profile of age-related difference across the 2 studies suggests a late onset, starting in the ninth decade, of clock slowing without age-related difference in timing error monitoring. The finding that unpaced timing is affected by age, whereas paced timing involved in SMS is not, suggests separate underlying mechanisms for internally generated intervals and monitoring of external timing errors.},

It is hypothesised that coping strategies may be predictive of pain intensity and pain-related disability at six months after initial consultation in primary care. Consecutive patients aged fifty years and over with musculoskeletal pain were recruited from general practice consultations. A self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to participants at baseline, with a follow-up questionnaire mailed six months later. Coping was assessed using The Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), pain and pain related disability were measured using domains of The Chronic Pain Grade (CPG). Associations between coping strategies and pain and disability were investigated using ordinary least squares regression. Crude analysis revealed catastrophizing at baseline was predictive of higher levels of pain and disability at baseline and was predictive of disability at six months. The association between catastrophizing and pain and pain related disability at follow-up was not significant once adjustments were made for age, gender and baseline anxiety and depression. Increasing behaviour and self-statements were not associated with pain or disability at follow-up. Ignoring pain sensations was predictive of increased pain at follow-up. This study highlights the relationship between catastrophizing in predicting pain and pain related disability may be mediated by other factors such as anxiety and depression. Ignoring sensations in those with high levels of pain may be maladaptive in older people with musculoskeletal pain.},

METHODS: The spontaneous EEG was recorded during rest and before painful stimulation of the calf and analyzed with spectral analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation). Outcome measures, i.e., alpha indices (center of gravity and overall amplitude), were statistically tested between patients with and without persistent pain.

RESULTS: In comparison with patients without pain, patients with persistent pain after breast cancer treatment show more alpha activity in their spontaneous EEG observed from parietal-occipital brain regions.

CONCLUSION: Persistent pain after breast cancer treatment affects spontaneous brain activity, which might influence cognitive functioning.},

Two-thirds of these costs are indirect, due to lost wages and reduced productivity. Each year, the fewer than 5{\%} of the patients who have an episode of low-back pain account for 75{\%} of the total costs. Because indirect costs rely heavily on changes in work status, total costs are difficult to calculate for many women and students as well as elderly and disabled patients. These methodologic challenges notwithstanding, the toll of lumbar disc disorders is enormous, underscoring the critical importance of identifying strategies to prevent these disorders and their consequences.},

Data analysis indicated that the questionnaire was internally reliable. While patients reported using a variety of coping strategies, certain strategies were used frequently whereas others were rarely used. Three factors: (a) Cognitive Coping and Suppression, (b) Helplessness, and (c) Diverting Attention or Praying, accounted for a large proportion of variance in questionnaire responses. These 3 factors were found to be predictive of measures of behavioral and emotional adjustment to chronic pain above and beyond what may be predicted on the basis of patient history variables (length of continuous pain, disability status, and number of pain surgeries) and the tendency of patients to somaticize. Each of the 3 coping factors was related to specific measures of adjustment to chronic pain.},

abstract = {Although emotion regulation modulates the pain experience, inconsistencies have been identified regarding the impact of specific regulation strategies on pain. Our goal was to examine the effects of emotion suppression and cognitive reappraisal on automatic (ie, nonverbal) and cognitively mediated (ie, verbal) pain expressions. Nonclinical participants were randomized into either a suppression (n = 58), reappraisal (n = 51), or monitoring control (n = 42) condition. Upon arrival to the laboratory, participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, to quantify self-reported suppression and reappraisal tendencies. Subsequently, they completed a thermal pain threshold and tolerance task. They were then provided with instructions to use, depending on their experimental condition, suppression, reappraisal, or monitoring strategies. Afterward, they were exposed to experimentally induced pain. Self-report measures of pain, anxiety, and tension were administered, and facial expressions, heart rate, and galvanic skin response were recorded. The Facial Action Coding System was used to quantify general and pain-related facial activity (ie, we defined facial actions that occurred during at least 5{\%} of pain stimulation periods as "pain-related actions"). Reappraisal and suppression induction led to reductions in nonverbal and verbal indices of pain. Moreover, self-reported tendencies to use suppression and reappraisal (as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire) did not interact with experimental condition in the determination of participants' responses. Results suggest that consciously applying emotion regulation strategies during a painful task can moderate both cognitively mediated (eg, verbal) and automatic (eg, facial activity) expressions of pain.},

abstract = {We previously reported that effective treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) reversed abnormal brain structure and functional MRI (fMRI) activity during cognitive task performance, particularly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we used resting-state fMRI to examine how chronic pain affects connectivity of brain networks supporting cognitive functioning and the effect of treatment in 14 CLBP patients and 16 healthy, pain-free controls (scans were acquired at baseline for all subjects and at 6-months post-treatment for patients and a matched time-point for 10 controls). The main networks activated during cognitive task performance, task-positive network (TPN) and task-negative network (TNN) (aka default mode) network, were identified in subjects' task fMRI data and used to define matching networks in resting-state data. The connectivity of these cognitive resting-state networks was compared between groups, and before and after treatment. Our findings converged on the bilateral insula (INS) as the region of aberrant cognitive resting-state connectivity in patients pretreatment versus controls. These findings were complemented by an independent, data-driven approach showing altered global connectivity of the INS. Detailed investigation of the INS confirmed reduced connectivity to widespread TPN and TNN areas, which was partially restored post-treatment. Furthermore, analysis of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data revealed structural changes in white matter supporting these findings. The left DLPFC also showed aberrant connectivity that was restored post-treatment. Altogether, our findings implicate the bilateral INS and left DLPFC as key nodes of disrupted cognition-related intrinsic connectivity in CLBP, and the resulting imbalance between TPN and TNN function is partially restored with treatment.},

Studies have found that symptom appraisal time--the time that passes before the individual concludes that their symptoms could be serious--accounts for most of the total delay time across subjects. It is thus important to understand the individual characteristics associated with slow recognition of dangerous symptoms. In this study, 62 patients (38 males) recently diagnosed with rectal cancer answered questions regarding the development of symptoms as well as their decisions and behaviors prior to seeking help. One subgroup of patients--males with the lowest scores on a measure of trait anxiety--took significantly longer to recognize the seriousness of their symptoms as compared to all other patients. This finding is discussed in the context of recent studies where the interaction of sex and negative affect is related to symptom reporting and other health-related behaviors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ), a nine-item scale designed to rapidly assess the cognitive and emotional representations of illness.

METHODS: We assessed the test-retest reliability of the scale in 132 renal outpatients. We assessed concurrent validity by comparing the Brief IPQ with the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R) and other relevant measures in 309 asthma, 132 renal, and 119 diabetes outpatients. Predictive validity was established by examining the relationship of Brief IPQ scores to outcomes in a sample of 103 myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Discriminant validity was examined by comparing scores on the Brief IPQ between five different illness groups.

RESULTS: The Brief IPQ showed good test-retest reliability and concurrent validity with relevant measures. The scale also demonstrated good predictive validity in patients recovering from MI with individual items being related to mental and physical functioning at 3 months' follow-up, cardiac rehabilitation class attendance, and speed of return to work. The discriminant validity of the Brief IPQ was supported by its ability to distinguish between different illnesses.

CONCLUSION: The Brief IPQ provides a rapid assessment of illness perceptions, which could be particularly helpful in ill populations, large-scale studies, and in repeated measures research designs.},

@article{Ceko2015b,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: In studies of cognitive processing using tasks with externally directed attention, regions showing increased (external-task-positive) and decreased or "negative" [default-mode network (DMN)] fMRI responses during task performance are dynamically responsive to increasing task difficulty. Responsiveness (modulation of fMRI signal by increasing load) has been linked directly to successful cognitive task performance in external-task-positive regions but not in DMN regions. To investigate whether a responsive DMN is required for successful cognitive performance, we compared healthy human subjects (n = 23) with individuals shown to have decreased DMN engagement (chronic pain patients, n = 28). Subjects performed a multilevel working-memory task (N-back) during fMRI. If a responsive DMN is required for successful performance, patients having reduced DMN responsiveness should show worsened performance; if performance is not reduced, their brains should show compensatory activation in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. All subjects showed decreased accuracy and increased reaction times with increasing task level, with no significant group differences on either measure at any level. Patients had significantly reduced negative fMRI response (deactivation) of DMN regions (posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Controls showed expected modulation of DMN deactivation with increasing task difficulty. Patients showed significantly reduced modulation of DMN deactivation by task difficulty, despite their successful task performance. We found no evidence of compensatory neural recruitment in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. Individual responsiveness of the external-task-positive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but not of DMN regions, correlated with task accuracy. These findings suggest that a responsive DMN may not be required for successful cognitive performance; a responsive external-task-positive network may be sufficient.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We studied the relationship between responsiveness of the brain to increasing task demand and successful cognitive performance, using chronic pain patients as a probe. fMRI working memory studies show that two main cognitive networks ["external-task positive" and "default-mode network" (DMN)] are responsive to increasing task difficulty. The responsiveness of both of these brain networks is suggested to be required for successful task performance. The responsiveness of external-task-positive regions has been linked directly to successful cognitive task performance, as we also show here. However, pain patients show decreased engagement and responsiveness of the DMN but can perform a working memory task as well as healthy subjects, without demonstrable compensatory neural recruitment. Therefore, a responsive DMN might not be needed for successful cognitive performance.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An epidemiological cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of psychosocial factors, both work and nonwork-related, on the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) after 6.6 years on average. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is growing consensus that psychosocial factors play a role in the development of LBP, although results are not consistent across studies. METHODS: Within a sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women from the Belstress study, baseline psychosocial factors were measured through self-administered questionnaires and related to prevalent cases of LBP after a mean time interval of 6.6 years through Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment for individual and physical risks, including occasional back pain at baseline, the prevalence rate of LBP in men is significantly related to baseline low decision latitude and low social support at work, and nonsignificantly to high job strain, low wage and job satisfaction, feeling stressed at work, and feeling depressed. High job insecurity, feeling stressed at work, and feeling depressed nonsignificantly increase the relative risks for LBP in women. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, psychosocial factors (both work and nonwork-related) constitute nonnegligible risks for the development of LBP.},

abstract = {The problem of alienation is a pervasive theme in the classics of sociology, and the concept has a prominent place in contemporary work. This paper seeks to accomplish two tasks: to present an organized view of the uses that have been made of this concept; and to provide an approach that ties the historical interest in alienation to the modern empirical effort. Five alternative meanings of alienation are identified: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. The derivation of these meanings from traditional sociological analysis is sketched, and the necessity for making the indicated distinctions is specified.

abstract = {Research in cognitive psychology has made a significant contribution to our understanding of how acute and chronic stress affect performance. It has done so by identifying some of the factors that contribute to operator error and by suggesting how operators might be trained to respond more effectively in a variety of circumstances. The major purpose of this paper was to review the literature of cognitive psychology as it relates to these questions and issues. Based on the existence of earlier reviews (e.g., Hamilton, {\&} Warburton, 1979; Hockey, 1983) the following investigation was limited to the last 15 years (1988-2002) and restricted to a review of the primary peer-reviewed literature. The results of this examination revealed that while cognitive psychology has contributed in a substantive way to our understanding of stress impact on various cognitive processes, it has also left many questions unanswered. Concerns about how we define and use the term stress and the gaps that remain in our knowledge about the specific effects of stressors on cognitive processes are discussed in the text.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To propose a conceptualization that identifies when diagnostic delays occur and suggests a delay-reduction strategy for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

DATA SOURCES: Findings and extrapolations from published national and international research studies, research reviews, books, Internet sources, and a family-functioning research project.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Three phases of diagnosis seeking were identified. Self-care was characterized by self-diagnosis, self-interpretation of symptoms, and self-management. Primary provider care was characterized by misdiagnosis and ineffective symptom management. Specialist care was characterized by specialized examinations, tests, and definitive diagnoses. Diagnostic delays were associated with extended periods of self-care and the misinterpretation of symptoms in primary care.

CONCLUSIONS: Periods of opportunity for early diagnosis occurred in the early symptom stages, when self- and primary care were dominant.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Women must be taught to self-monitor for early ovarian cancer symptoms. Primary care providers should be urged to attend frequent state-of-the-science updates that regard early symptoms as manifestations of ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {The present article explores the functions of music listening from a cross-cultural perspective. We present a model of functions of music listening based on a multicultural qualitative approach. Our model covers personal, social and cultural musical experiences. Seven main functions of music listening were identified: music in the background, memories through music, music as diversion, emotions and self-regulation through music, music as reflection of self and social bonding through music. Our model was confirmed in an independent sample using a cross-method validation. Quantitative analyses of the qualitative data explored the salience of functions of music listening across four sub-samples: Asian and Latin-American sub-samples being more collectivistic and non- Anglophone Western and Anglophone Western sub-samples being more individualistic. Across all sub-samples the self-regulation function was the most important personal use of music, bonding was the most important social use of music and the expression of cultural identity was the most salient cultural function of music regardless of listeners' cultural background. Apart from these similarities which point towards universalities, we also revealed cross-cultural differences pointing towards culture-specific uses of music. Limitations in the methodology of this exploratory cross-cultural approach and future directions in cross-cultural psychology of music are discussed.},

abstract = {One response to the increasing demand for physiotherapy services from primary care is to develop group exercise programmes led by physiotherapists operating in an educational/advisory role. However, since physical symptoms in patients referred from primary care are often mediated by complex and unrecognised psychosocial factors, it is not clear what format of group physiotherapy will engage such patients in a programme of exercise training. This paper reports problems experienced with patient engagement in physiotherapist-led groups undertaking either an aerobic exercise or a stretching and relaxation programme. The programmes formed, respectively, the intervention and control arms of a study investigating the role of exercise in primary care patients with persistent unexplained physical symptoms. We outline ways in which these problems were addressed and review our experience in the light of previous research on patient engagement with exercise.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of music for the treatment of pain has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of music on acute, chronic or cancer pain intensity, pain relief, and analgesic requirements. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS and the references in retrieved manuscripts. There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of music on any type of pain in children or adults. We excluded trials that reported results of concurrent non-pharmacological therapies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted by two independent review authors. We calculated the mean difference in pain intensity levels, percentage of patients with at least 50{\%} pain relief, and opioid requirements. We converted opioid consumption to morphine equivalents. To explore heterogeneity, studies that evaluated adults, children, acute, chronic, malignant, labor, procedural, or experimental pain were evaluated separately, as well as those studies in which patients chose the type of music. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-one studies involving 1867 subjects exposed to music and 1796 controls met inclusion criteria.In the 31 studies evaluating mean pain intensity there was a considerable variation in the effect of music, indicating statistical heterogeneity ( I(2) = 85.3{\%}). After grouping the studies according to the pain model, this heterogeneity remained, with the exception of the studies that evaluated acute postoperative pain. In this last group, patients exposed to music had pain intensity that was 0.5 units lower on a zero to ten scale than unexposed subjects (95{\%} CI: -0.9 to -0.2). Studies that permitted patients to select the music did not reveal a benefit from music; the decline in pain intensity was 0.2 units, 95{\%} CI (-0.7 to 0.2).Four studies reported the proportion of subjects with at least 50{\%} pain relief; subjects exposed to music had a 70{\%} higher likelihood of having pain relief than unexposed subjects (95{\%} CI: 1.21 to 2.37). NNT = 5 (95{\%} CI: 4 to 13).Three studies evaluated opioid requirements two hours after surgery: subjects exposed to music required 1.0 mg (18.4{\%}) less morphine (95{\%} CI: -2.0 to -0.2) than unexposed subjects. Five studies assessed requirements 24 hours after surgery: the music group required 5.7 mg (15.4{\%}) less morphine than the unexposed group (95{\%} CI: -8.8 to -2.6). Five studies evaluated requirements during painful procedures: the difference in requirements showed a trend towards favoring the music group (-0.7 mg, 95{\%} CI: -1.8 to 0.4). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Listening to music reduces pain intensity levels and opioid requirements, but the magnitude of these benefits is small and, therefore, its clinical importance unclear.},

@article{McCutchan2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: People from lower socioeconomic groups have worse survival outcomes for cancer, which in part reflects later-stage disease at diagnosis. The mechanisms underlying delayed cancer symptom presentation in lower socioeconomic groups are not well understood.

METHODS: Systematic review of studies of actual or anticipated symptom presentation across all tumour sites. Included studies measured socioeconomic group, symptom presentation and one or more of the following variables: cancer symptom knowledge, beliefs about cancer, barriers/facilitators to symptom presentation.

RESULTS: A total of 60 studies was included. Symptom knowledge overall was lowest and actual presentation time was longest in lower socioeconomic groups. Knowledge for specific symptoms such as lumps and bleeding was good and encouraged timely symptom presentation, in contrast to non-specific symptoms which were not well recognised. The combination of fearful and fatalistic beliefs was typically associated with later presentation, especially in lower socioeconomic groups. Emotional barriers such as 'worry what the doctor might find' were more frequently reported in lower socioeconomic groups, and there was evidence to suggest that disclosing symptoms to family/friends could help or hinder early presentation.

CONCLUSIONS: Poor symptom knowledge, fearful and fatalistic beliefs about cancer, and emotional barriers combine to prolong symptom presentation among lower socioeconomic groups. Targeted interventions should utilise social networks to improve knowledge of non-specific symptoms, challenge negative beliefs and encourage help-seeking, in order to reduce avoidable delays and minimise socioeconomic group inequalities.},

Design: Structural equation modeling. Participants: Individuals with chronic pain (N = 171), recruited from 6 outpatient rehabilitation facilities in Canada. Outcome Measures: Two measures of the latent variable, depression (the Center for Epiderniologic Studies-Depression Scale and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), along with multiple measures of each of 5 latent predictors (pain, interferences, stress, coping, and social and family support) and 2 measured predictors (preinjury psychopathology and catastrophizing). Results: The normed fit index, comparative fit index, and parsimony ratio indicated an adequate fit for the model, suggesting that stress, perceived severity of pain, activity interferences, and catastrophizing contributed to increased depression (vulnerabilities), whereas pain coping skills and social and family support contributed to decreased depression (immunities). Conclusions: Empirical support was found for the proposed model of depression for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the model appears to provide useful information for clinical rehabilitation interventions.},

abstract = {In the field of psychology, the first studies in experimental aesthetics were conducted approximately 140 years ago. Since then, research has mainly concentrated on aesthetic responses to visual art. Both the aesthetic experience of music and, especially, its development have received rather limited attention. Moreover, until now, very little attention has been paid to the investigation of the aesthetic experience of music using neuroscientific methods. Aesthetic experiences are multidimensional and include inter alia sensory, perceptual, affective, and cognitive components. Aesthetic processes are usually experienced as pleasing and rewarding and are, thus, important and valuable experiences for many people. Because of their multidimensional nature, these processes employ several brain areas. In the present review, we examine important psychological and neural mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the development of aesthetic experiences of music. We also discuss relevant research findings. With the present review, we wish to provoke further discussion and possible future investigations as we consider the investigation of aesthetic experiences to be important both scientifically and with respect to potential clinical applications.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The purpose of this work was to find out whether there is interdependence between the patients- assessments of biological, psychological, psychosocial and spiritual levels. METHODS 590 subjects, both ill and healthy, were examined by appropriate means and asked to consider their level of fear, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Modification), aggression, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire), and the purpose and meaning of life (The "PURPOSE in Life Test" - PIL questionnaire). RESULTS Three groups of patients were established with the help of statistical procedures. The first group encompassed the healthy subjects, whereas the second and third included those that were ill. Although the subjects estimated their level of physical fitness and general quality of life similarly, there were some essential differences in their disease-associated reactions (i.e. the groups adjusted differently - the second group poorly and the third well). The majority of people suffering from cancer were well adapted to the early stages of the disease. As cancer progressed the percentage of those that adjusted poorly rose. However, even in the terminal stage some of the patients, about 1/3, still belonged to the group of those that were quite well adjusted. Established meaning of life, system of values, and personal religion were factors that helped to adapt. CONCLUSIONS There was no connection between the patients' assessments of their biological level and other (psychological, psychosocial, spiritual) levels. We can distinguish groups of patients that judge their physical condition similarly and still vary in the assessment of their emotional state or meaning of life.},

abstract = {There is an unprecedented opportunity for psychologists and behavioral scientists to merge prior theory and research with big data to develop profound insights into the way people use and are affected by music. There are now streaming services that store data from millions of people on their day-to-day musical listening habits; song-level data that tags sonic and emotion attributes for millions of songs; wearable devices (e.g. watches and earbuds) that capture physiological metrics including heartrate and galvanic skin response; mobile technologies that track a person's moment-to-moment activity, location, mood, and sociability; and survey instruments and digital footprints that capture personality and other biopsychosocial metrics in just under a minute. We propose that merging these technologies can create a new age in music psychology that exponentially expands the present knowledge and scope of the field. The new data will advance general areas of music psychology, but will also provide an important opportunity to establish new knowledge about health and well-being that can have a direct impact on the public. By scientifically mapping how music changes behavior and health in the short-term and long-term, Big Music Data can lead to future health initiatives including the development of new evidence-based treatment modalities to be utilized by medical physicians and mental health practitioners. Importantly, industry and streaming services can use these new insights to optimize their technologies and develop music-based health and wellness platforms aimed at improving the well-being of its users, ultimately impacting the way music is used by millions of people globally.},

In 1996, Smith et al identified a prevalence rate of PMPS of 43{\%} among 408 women in the Grampian Region, Northeast Scotland. The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome at 7-12 years postoperatively in this cohort of women, to describe the natural history of PMPS and impact of pain upon quality of life. Chronic pain and quality of life were assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Of 175 women reporting PMPS in 1996, 138 were eligible for questionnaire follow-up in 2002. Mean time since surgery was 9 years (s.d. 1.8 years). A response rate of 82{\%} (113 out of 138) was achieved; 59 out of 113 (52{\%}) women reported continued PMPS and 54 out of 113 (48{\%}) women reported their PMPS had resolved since the previous survey in 1996. Quality of life scores were significantly lower in women with persistent PMPS compared to those women whose pain had resolved. However, for women with persistent PMPS, SF-36 scores had improved over time. Risk factors for persistent PMPS included younger age and heavier weight. This study found that, of women reporting PMPS in 1996, half of those surveyed in 2002 continued to experience PMPS at a mean of 9 years after surgery.},

abstract = {The discovery of genetic variants that substantially alter an individual's perception of pain has led to a step-change in our understanding of molecular events underlying the detection and transmission of noxious stimuli by the peripheral nervous system. For example, the voltage-gated sodium ion channel Nav1.7 is expressed selectively in sensory and autonomic neurons; inactivating mutations in SCN9A, which encodes Nav1.7, result in congenital insensitivity to pain, whereas gain-of-function mutations in this gene produce distinct pain syndromes such as inherited erythromelalgia, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, and small-fibre neuropathy. Heterozygous mutations in TRPA1, which encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel, can cause familial episodic pain syndromes, and variants of genes coding for the voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.8 (SCN10A) and Nav1.9 (SCN11A) lead to small-fibre neuropathy and congenital insensitivity to pain, respectively. Furthermore, other genetic polymorphisms have been identified that contribute to risk or severity of more complex pain phenotypes. Novel models of sensory disorders are in development-eg, using human sensory neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Understanding rare heritable pain disorders not only improves diagnosis and treatment of patients but may also reveal new targets for analgesic drug development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate worldwide prevalence of chronic low back pain according to age and sex.METHODS We consulted Medline (PubMed), LILACS and EMBASE electronic databases. The search strategy used the following descriptors and combinations: back pain, prevalence, musculoskeletal diseases, chronic musculoskeletal pain, rheumatic, low back pain, musculoskeletal disorders and chronic low back pain. We selected cross-sectional population-based or cohort studies that assessed chronic low back pain as an outcome. We also assessed the quality of the selected studies as well as the chronic low back pain prevalence according to age and sex.RESULTS The review included 28 studies. Based on our qualitative evaluation, around one third of the studies had low scores, mainly due to high non-response rates. Chronic low back pain prevalence was 4.2{\%} in individuals aged between 24 and 39 years old and 19.6{\%} in those aged between 20 and 59. Of nine studies with individuals aged 18 and above, six reported chronic low back pain between 3.9{\%} and 10.2{\%} and three, prevalence between 13.1{\%} and 20.3{\%}. In the Brazilian older population, chronic low back pain prevalence was 25.4{\%}.CONCLUSIONS Chronic low back pain prevalence increases linearly from the third decade of life on, until the 60 years of age, being more prevalent in women. Methodological approaches aiming to reduce high heterogeneity in case definitions of chronic low back pain are essential to consistency and comparative analysis between studies. A standard chronic low back pain definition should include the precise description of the anatomical area, pain duration and limitation level.},

abstract = {Anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing are generally considered to be predictive of chronic postoperative pain, but this may not be the case after all types of surgery, raising the possibility that the results depend on the surgical model. We assessed the predictive value of these factors for chronic postsurgical pain in 2 different surgical models: total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis (89 patients, 65{\%} women, age = 69 ?? 9 years, baseline pain intensity = 4.7 ?? 2.1) and breast surgery for cancer (100 patients, 100{\%} women, age = 55 ?? 12 years, no preoperative pain). Data were collected before surgery, then 2 days and 3 months after surgery. Anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing were measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale, respectively. Pain was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory. Neuropathic pain was detected with the DN4 questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses for the total knee arthroplasty and breast surgery models considered together indicated that the presence of clinically meaningful chronic pain at 3 months (pain intensity ???3/10) was predicted independently by age (P =.04), pain intensity on day 2 (P =.009), and state anxiety (P =.001). Linear regression models also showed that pain magnification, one of the dimensions of catastrophizing, independently predicted chronic pain intensity (P =.04). These results were not affected by the surgical model or by the neuropathic characteristics of the pain. Thus, state anxiety and pain magnification seem to constitute psychological risk factors for chronic postsurgical pain relevant in all surgical models. Perspective: This prospective study performed in patients with total knee arthroplasty or breast surgery for cancer shows that state anxiety, amplification of pain, and acute postoperative pain independently predict postsurgical pain at 3 months and that this does not depend on the surgical model. ?? 2013 by the American Pain Society.},

abstract = {This study is aimed at investigating factors leading to delayed oncologic examinations versus immediate consultation with a physician in patients with various cancers. We analysed the results of a study of patients (n = 291) reporting for their first oncologic examinations. We conducted structured interviews containing social, demographic and clinical data, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and Harris and Guten's health appraisal scores. Based on an analysis of decision-making trees, the results indicate that it is possible to predict beliefs regarding the curability of cancer and immediate versus delayed reporting to a physician. Delayed reports may be predicted on the basis of two factors: (1) a belief that cancer is incurable combined with increased state anxiety, 'good' or 'very good' self-appraisal of health and low depression; and (2) a belief that cancer is incurable accompanied by increased anxiety and depression. The characteristics of patients delaying a visit to the oncologist suggest the existence of three independent factors leading to both considerable (longer than nine months) and minor (up to one month) delays in seeking treatment.},

This chapter discusses two novel research developments in music performance: (1) body movement and its relation to sounded performance and (2) sensorimotor processes in ensemble performance (measurements of two or more performers). Motion capture measurements of performers' body movements have documented constraints shaped by three primary factors: sensorimotor integration processes, biomechanical properties, and the performers' expressive intentions. Recent measurements of ensemble performance, compared with solo performance, document the influence of sensory feedback from oneself versus other performers and constraints that arise from interactions among ensemble members. Important individual differences are reviewed in how musicians adapt to their partners in ensemble settings. In summary, developments in measurement techniques and time series analyses have yielded intriguing insights in the online use of multiple sensory systems during music performance, which are reviewed in this chapter.

abstract = {Facial expression of affective states plays a key role in social interactions. Interestingly, however, individuals differ substantially in their level of expressiveness, ranging from high expressive to stoic individuals. Here, we investigate which brain mechanisms underlie the regulation of facial expressiveness to acute pain. Facial responses, pain ratings, and brain activity (BOLD-fMRI) evoked by noxious heat and warm (control) stimuli were recorded in 34 human volunteers with different degrees of facial expressiveness. Within-subject and between-subject variations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were examined specifically in relation to facial responses. Pain expression was inversely related to frontostriatal activity, consistent with a role in downregulating facial displays. More detailed analyses of the peak activity in medial prefrontal cortex revealed negative BOLD responses to thermal stimuli, an effect generally associated with the default mode network. Given that this negative BOLD response was weaker in low expressive individuals during pain, it could reflect stronger engagement in, or reduced disengagement from, self-reflective processes in stoic individuals. The occurrence of facial expressions during pain was coupled with stronger primary motor activity in the face area and-interestingly-in areas involved in pain processing. In conclusion, these results indicate that spontaneous pain expression reflects activity within nociceptive pathways while stoicism involves the active suppression of expression, a manifestation of learned display rules governing emotional communication and possibly related to an increased self-reflective or introspective focus.},

We hypothesized that illness threats are represented by their labels and symptoms (their identity), their causes, consequences, and duration. These attributes are represented at two levels: as concrete, immediately perceptible events and as abstract ideas. Both levels guide coping behavior. We interviewed 230 patients about hypertension, presumably an asymptomatic condition. When asked if they could monitor blood pressure changes, 46{\%} of 50 nonhypertensive, clinic control cases said yes, as did 71{\%} of 65 patients new to treatment, 92{\%} of 50 patients in continuing treatment, and 94{\%} of 65 re-entry patients, who had previously quit and returned to treatment. Patients in the continuing treatment group, who believed the treatment had beneficial effects upon their symptoms, reported complying with medication and were more likely to have their blood pressure controlled. Patients new to treatment were likely to drop out of treatment if: they had reported symptoms to the practitioner at the first treatment session, or they construed the disease and treatment to be acute. The data suggest that patients develop implicit models or beliefs about disease threats, which guide their treatment behavior, and that the initially most common model of high blood pressure is based on prior acute, symptomatic conditions.},

We expected that listening to music, because of its emotional impact, would have a greater modulating effect on the perception of pain and fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia than listening to nonmusical sounds. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a 4-week study in which patients with fibromyalgia listened to either preselected musical pieces or environmental sounds when they experienced pain in active (while carrying out a physical activity) or passive (at rest) situations. Concomitant changes of pain and fatigue levels were evaluated. When patients listened to music or environmental sounds at rest, pain and fatigue levels were significantly reduced after 20 minutes of listening, with no difference of effect magnitude between the two stimuli. This improvement persisted 10 minutes after the end of the listening session. In active situations, pain did not increase in presence of the two stimuli. Contrary to our expectations, music and environmental sounds produced a similar relieving effect on pain and fatigue, with no benefit gained by listening to pleasant music over environmental sounds.},

Results suggest that individual differences in personality and cognitive ability may partly determine the way in which we experience music.

This definition re- places the 17-year old definition that appeared in the Classification of Chronic Pain published by IASP in 1994 [7], which defined neu- ropathic pain as ‘‘pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion, dys- function, or transitory perturbation of the peripheral or central nervous system''. Even though the definition has not been changed dramatically, there are two important changes in the new version: (1) the word ‘‘dysfunction'' has been removed and (2) a lesion or disease affecting the nervous system has been specified to be a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system.},

abstract = {Chronic pain conditions are associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function. Moreover, some studies indicate that brain activity related to the subjective perception of chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain. However, the latter are based on observations from cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored. Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for {\textgreater}10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20{\%} decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on {\textgreater}200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.},

abstract = {Context • Anesthesiologists use various medications to provide surgical patients with pain relief in the postoperative period. Other modalities, such as music, could be used in conjunction with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to decrease pain and lower heart rate and blood pressure. Our hypothesis was that patients listening to jazz in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) would have lower heart rates and blood pressures and reduced pain and anxiety. Objective • The study objective was to determine if listening to jazz music in the PACU, when compared to wearing noise-canceling headphones with no music playing, would decrease heart rate, blood pressure, pain, or anxiety in patients undergoing a hysterectomy. Design • The research design was a prospective, randomized study. Setting • The study was conducted in the PACU at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA, USA. Participants • A total of 56 patients, aged 18-75 y, who were categorized as status 1 or 2 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System, and who were undergoing elective laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies, were enrolled in the study. Intervention • Patients were randomly assigned either to listen to jazz music where the beats per min (BPM) was {\textless}100 (experimental group, n = 28) or to wear noise-canceling headphones (control group, n = 28) for 30 min while in the PACU after their surgery. Outcome Measures • Heart rate was the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, an anxiety score, and a pain score. All outcome measures were initially recorded at baseline upon the patient's arrival in the PACU. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded postoperatively every 5 min for the initial 30 min that a patient was in the PACU. Pain was checked every 10 min during the 30-min period; anxiety was checked at 30 min. Results • Heart rates of patients in the noise-cancellation group were significantly lower when compared with baseline (P {\textless} .05), at all time points. For patients in the jazz group, heart rates were significantly lower at 15, 20, 25, and 30 min when compared with baseline. The pain scores were significantly lower (P {\textless} .05) in the noise-cancellation group compared with the jazz group at 10 min into the recovery period. Conclusion • Overall, the results showed that patients responded not only to music but also to silence in the PACU. Using music and/or noise reduction could decrease opioid administration, promote relaxation, and improve patient satisfaction.},

Many drugs used for back pain are no more, or only slightly more, effective than placebos. Others have side effects that outweigh their usefulness in relieving pain. On the basis of the evidence, no drug regimen can be legitimately recommended for back pain. The management of back pain requires measures other than drugs. One exception is the use of willow (Salix) bark for acute exacerbation of pain. Ironically, for chronic low back pain, the most effective and long-lasting outcomes have been documented for normal saline by injection into tender points in the lumbar spine.},

abstract = {This research investigated psychological characteristics associated with delay in seeking help for symptoms of rectal cancer. Sixty nine subjects reconstructed pivotal events beginning with symptom onset and ending with medical consultation, and completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The mean delay time was around 6 months, with about 1 out of 6 subjects waiting one year or more. Subjects estimated the lengths of two sequential segments of total time to consultation: (1) Symptom Appraisal time (from symptom onset to recognition of possible seriousness), and (2) Action Appraisal time (from recognition of seriousness to medical consultation). Symptom Appraisal time accounted for over two-thirds of total time and was associated with low scores on the TCI Harm Avoidance scale (TCI-HA), indicating dispositional insensitivity to threat, and marginally associated with less education and younger age. Action Appraisal time was not associated with any demographic or psychological variables. Low TCI-HA scores were also associated with lower likelihood of previous cancer screening, and with better judgments of premorbid health. Low STAI Trait scores were associated with better judgments of premorbid health and fewer doctor visits. Results are discussed regarding the importance of understanding dispositional characteristics related to health behavior.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that the neural circuits involved in beat perception overlap with motor circuitry even in the absence of overt movement. This study investigated effects of tempo on beat-based processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a perceptual timing paradigm where participants made simple temporal judgments about short rhythmic sequences. Of central interest were judgments about ambiguous test rhythms where the perceived direction of a timing deviation ("speeding up" vs. "slowing down") depended on the induction of an implied beat. Successful beat induction was reduced when the implied beat was at a slower tempo (1,500 ms) than when it was at a faster tempo (600 ms). Decreased beat induction was accompanied by decreased functional activity in the basal ganglia, premotor and supplementary motor regions, and thalamus. Findings support the conclusion that rhythms presented at a slow tempo reduce involvement of a striato-thalamo-cortico network in beat-based processing.},

abstract = {Most patients with neuropathic pain symptoms present and are managed in primary care, with only a minority being referred for specialist clinical assessment and diagnoses. Previous reviews have focused mainly on specific neuropathic pain conditions based in specialist settings. This is the first systematic review of epidemiological studies of neuropathic pain in the general population. Electronic databases were searched from January 1966 to December 2012, and studies were included where the main focus was on neuropathic pain prevalence and/or incidence, either as part of a specific neuropathic pain-related condition or as a global entity in the general population. We excluded studies in which data were extracted from pain or other specialist clinics or focusing on specific population subgroups. Twenty-one articles were identified and underwent quality assessment and data extraction. Included studies differed in 3 main ways: method of data retrieval, case ascertainment tool used, and presentation of prevalence/incidence rates. This heterogeneity precluded any meta-analysis. We categorised comparable incidence and prevalence rates into 2 main subgroups: (1) chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (range 3-17{\%}), and (2) neuropathic pain associated with a specific condition, including postherpetic neuralgia (3.9-42.0/100,000 person-years [PY]), trigeminal neuralgia (12.6-28.9/100,000 PY), painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (15.3-72.3/100,000 PY), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (0.2-0.4/100,000 PY). These differences highlight the importance of a standardised approach for identifying neuropathic pain in future epidemiological studies. A best estimate of population prevalence of pain with neuropathic characteristics is likely to lie between 6.9{\%} and 10{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

A translated form of the FABQ has never been validated in Italian patients with LBP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The FABQ-I questionnaire was developed by means of forward-backward translation, a final review by an expert committee, and a test of the prefinal version to establish its correspondence with the original English version. The psychometric testing included factor analysis, reliability by internal consistency (Cronbach $\alpha$) and test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient correlation), convergent validity by comparing FABQ-I with the Italian version of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-I), and discriminant validity by comparing FABQ-I with a visual analogue scale, the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Pearson correlation).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: It took 4 months to develop a shared version of the FABQ-I. The questionnaire was administered to 180 subjects and proved to be acceptable. Factor analysis revealed a 2-factor, 12-item solution (57{\%} of explained variance). The questionnaire showed good internal consistency ($\alpha$ = 0.822) and high test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient correlation = 0.869). Convergent validity showed a moderate correlation with TSK-I (r = 0.440), and discriminant validity showed moderate-poor correlations with a visual analogue scale (r = 0.335), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (r = 0.414), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (r = 0.258 for the Anxiety score and r = 0.246 for the Depression score). The results of the psychometric analyses of the subscales were similar to those of the scale as a whole.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The FABQ outcome measure was successfully translated into Italian and proved to have a good factorial structure and psychometric properties that replicated the results of other existing versions. Its use is recommended for research purposes.},

abstract = {AIM: This paper is a report of a study to identify factors influencing delay in reporting symptoms of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer accounts for approximately 5{\%} of deaths in the Western world. For up to 80{\%} of patients, their disease is inoperable because it has been diagnosed too late. This suggests that reducing diagnostic delay could reduce mortality.

METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted from July 2005 to May 2006 in community and hospital settings in the United Kingdom. A purposive sample of people diagnosed with lung cancer in the previous 6 months (n = 18), and two 18-month survivors took part in individual interviews.

FINDINGS: Participants reported a range of interrelating factors that influenced delay in reporting symptoms of lung cancer. Barriers to symptom reporting included symptom experience, lack of knowledge and fear. Blame and stigma because of smoking were also prevalent influences, as well as cultural factors, non-standard patterns of healthcare utilization and underlying stoical attitudes. The only factor to emerge as helpful in overcoming delay was the role families played.

CONCLUSION: Lack of knowledge and awareness about lung cancer could be addressed by better education of the public. Social marketing is a way of developing education messages which tackle cultural influences on treatment-seeking delay. Nurses have a potential role in developing and disseminating those messages.},

It was tested on 169 patients with chronic low back pain, 164 (97{\%}) of them were enrolled, and 84 of 164 (53{\%}) returned the completed retest booklet within 2 to 14 days after the baseline test. There were no differences between the 2 groups in demographic and clinical parameters. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity were investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean ODI (standard deviation [SD]) was 48.45 (18.94); minimum 2, maximum 94. The Cronbach $\alpha$ for baseline questionnaires (n = 164) was 0.90. Concurrent validity, measured by comparing ODI responses with the results of the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire score was very good (r = 0.607, P {\textless} 0.001). The correlation with VAS back was fair (r = 0.37, P {\textless} 0.001) and with VAS leg was good (r = 0.56, P {\textless} 0.001). The tested ODI had excellent test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.97 and standard error of measurements was 3.54, the resulting minimal detectable changes at the 95{\%} confidence level was 10.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the Polish version of the ODI is a reliable and valid instrument for the measurement of disability in Polish-speaking patients with lower back pain.},
